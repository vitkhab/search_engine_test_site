Zuckerman and Markos Moulitsas Zúniga. Andy Oram did an initial edit
of many chapters, and was an early sounding board as I wrote. JD Lasica
and Brad King read the draft and made excellent suggestions. Rachel
Head copy-edited the final draft, and her tweaks and thoughts were a
further improvement. I’m sure I’ve forgotten to mention some others;
my apologies, and I trust they’ll know how much I appreciate their input.
The Mediactive project was conceived at the Berkman Center for
Internet & Society at Harvard University—an unparalleled pool of talent
and wisdom about our new digital environment. I was a Fellow there
from 2006–2009, and was asked by Persephone Miel, a Fellow who was
leading a project called “Media Re:public,” to write an essay for a longer
document she was creating on the state of media. That essay helped me
think through the principles that form the heart of this project.
Persephone died in the summer of 2010, too young, and is sorely missed
by all who knew her.
The book gestated at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism &
Mass Communication at Arizona State University, which has helped me
see journalism in new ways as well. The school’s terrific students, staff
and faculty are on the front lines of journalism’s evolution in this era of
accelerating change, and as a university ASU is working to create a more
modern model for higher education. Chris Callahan, the Cronkite
School’s extraordinary dean, has vision and energy that are unmatched in
his field, and it’s been an honor to be part of this team.
Portions of the book appeared first in my Mediactive blog and in
my new column on Salon.com. The people at Salon, a pioneer in the
online media world, combine a commitment to quality with a progressive
spirit that inspires me.
Josh Sprague, a former graduate student of mine at Arizona State,
has worked with me on the Mediactive project at various steps. His help
has been invaluable.
Monitor Talent manages my speaking and consulting gigs; Chris
Meyer, Mel Blake, Meghan Fennell and Jacqueline Lewis have offered
terrific advice about my career and Mediactive’s place in it.

Clay Shirky’s insights are no secret to his growing legion of fans, of
whom I’m one. He honored me by contributing the foreword to this
book, and his friendship is a continuing joy.
I owe special thanks to my literary agent, David Miller, who stayed
with this project even after it veered outside the traditional publishing
world. David, like me, is learning about the future of media. I’m grateful
for his extraordinary counsel.
The editor for this book is my longtime friend Tom Stites. He’s a
current Berkman Fellow and creator of the Banyan Project, which aims
to bring quality journalism back to the people who may need it most:
average folks who’ve been largely left behind. My instructions to Tom,
when he took on this project, were simple: Don’t let me off the hook. He
hasn’t, I’m glad to say, and the result is a vastly better book. Thank you,
Tom.
I’m a better person thanks to Noriko Takiguchi. She makes me
sane, and lights my life.
