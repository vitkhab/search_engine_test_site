# Chapter 11
A Path to Tomorrow
So, what’s missing?
As we move into the next generation of news and trustworthy
information, what tools, techniques and business models need to be
invented or perfected? What attitudes need to change in the general
public? The list is too long for one book. But here are some of the most
important “next steps” I can name right now:
 Create community-based networks of trust, using reputation as
an essential component.
 Improve the tools of discovery and context, via aggregation and
curation.
 Make the topic the primary focus of reporting, with dynamic
“articles” that advance understanding through successive
iterations as new information becomes available.
 Find and catalog the best ideas, techniques and tools, and then
connect them with people who can bring them to a wider
public.
 Get policy right on copyright and broadband. Eliminate
subsidies, direct and indirect, that favor one type of media
business over another.
 Develop payment systems that reward creators in all parts of
the new media ecosystem.
 Make critical thinking and media literacy part of education’s
core curriculum.
 Do away with almost all journalism prizes, and bring the ones
we want to keep into the 21st century.
 Work toward a national consensus on identity and
accountability that encourages people to stand behind their
words and to cut each other slack for past foolish acts and
remarks.
160 Mediactive
 Continue the conversations.
Let me expand on some of these.
Topics and Baselines, Not Stories
If Steven Spielberg and other Hollywood folks can create directors’
cuts of their movies, why can’t journalists do the same—and more? Why
can’t they keep updating and improving their own published works?
Actually, they can, if they can get past the publication and broadcast
models from the age of literally manufactured media, where the printed
paper product or recording tape was the end of the process.
This is not just about newspapers or television and radio
broadcasts. It’s about books, too—in fact, about any of the media forms
that are making the transition into the Digital Age. The Mediactive
project represents my own attempt to put this notion and others into
practice.
In life, we accrete knowledge. We learn a little more about things as
we go along, and we factor that new information into a new
understanding of the larger topics.
This model maps to the way the Web works. On the Web, the best
explainers accrete audiences and authority, as they attract more and more
readers and inbound links. As mediactive knowledge accretes, you’ll find
it in updates to the Mediactive website.
Because of its manufacturing model, traditional journalism has done
things in a different way. The process has been to create a new story each
time a bit more information about a person, topic or issue becomes
available, and either to expect audiences to have enough background to
understand why this turn of the screw matters or to add some
background information that attempts to bring the reader/viewer/
listener up to speed.
This is inefficient, both for the journalists and for the audience. But
in an online world, we can easily do better.
One way to do it better: Create topic articles that are dynamic, with
successive iterations adding (and subtracting) from the original as new
information comes to light. This isn’t a new idea—Wikipedia, after all, is
precisely about this kind of approach, as I noted when I wrote about it in
2005—but it’s gaining currency. (Jeff Jarvis put it especially well in his
blog, BuzzMachine.com, when he wrote: “The building block of
journalism is no longer the article.” Jay Rosen and Matt Thompson, in a
panel at the 2010 South by Southwest Interactive conference, greatly 
Dan Gillmor 161
expanded on this notion when they examined what they called the “future
of context,” and created a website for it.)
Some models are already available. Consider Wikipedia, where every
version of each article that is written—and I mean everything, down to
the version where someone added a comma and hit the save button—is
available to anyone who wants to see it. You can even compare edited
versions side by side.
In the real world, how might this work?
Let’s say I’m just starting to understand the role of financial tools
called “collateralized debt obligations” (CDOs) in the 2008 financial
meltdown. And suppose that the New York Times had done a detailed
explainer of CDOs. (I can’t find one, but perhaps it did.) Now comes the
important part: Let’s further suppose that the Times has been updating that
article on the Web to reflect new events, in addition to writing current
news stories (and archiving them next to the original) and creating a huge
link directory. The newer stories have lots of new details, only the most
central of which make it back into the updated original explainer.
The Times has actually gone part of the way in this direction. Under the
umbrella of “Times Topics” you’ll find a huge aggregation of articles that
have appeared in the paper, including a page on CDOs. What you won’t find
is what I’d like to see as well: the original uber-explainer—call it the baseline
copy—and then the current, updated version so you can see what’s changed.
Alternatively, it might be nice to see them mashed together, with the
changes highlighted using colors for additions and strike-throughs for
deletions. (You also won’t find, inexplicably and inexcusably, an element that
would vastly improve a Times Topics page: links to journalism other than
the newspaper’s own stories.)
The average reader would probably go to the updated Big Topic
story, starting and ending there for the moment. Then, when new
journalism appeared about CDOs, he or she would have more useful
background to understand the nuances.
Again, as noted above, this idea isn’t all that new. In fact, wire
services understood it a long time ago. The Associated Press and others
have long used what’s called the “write-through”—adding new
information to breaking news and telling editors what’s new in the story.
Now, by adapting this to the Web, we can tell everyone.
Updating Updates and Corrections
Not only can we tell people what’s new, but we can (and should)
tell them what we’ve gotten wrong. I’ve noted in earlier chapters that a 
162 Mediactive
key part of transparency is telling our audiences about our mistakes and
fixing them quickly—but that’s not all we can or should do.
As we update our baseline stories (and anything else we publish), we
can show our audience what’s changed. Scott Rosenberg, author of several
books about the Internet, is among several people to suggest that a
software industry technique called “versioning” become a normal part of
journalism.
Scott, a friend who has worked with me on several projects, started
pushing this after Politico. comexcised a highly relevant tidbit from a
story and then pretended that what it had removed—an admission of
how insider journalism, Politico’s stock in trade, actually works—wasn’t
important in the first place. He wrote:
Any news organization that strives to present a version of reality
to its readers or users must come to grips with the fact that reality
is always changing. Print publications have always taken daily,
weekly or monthly snapshots of that reality, and everyone
understands the relationship between the publication date and
the information published under it. Radio and TV offer a closerto-live
reflection of the ever-changing news reality, but until the
Web’s arrival their content was so fleeting that the new update
pretty much obliterated the old version of any story.
The Web changes all of this. It is both up-to-the-minute and
timeless—ephemeral and archival. This offers newsrooms a
fundamentally different opportunity for presenting timely
story updates while honoring and preserving the record of
previous versions. Sadly, not a single news organization I’m
aware of has yet taken advantage of this opportunity.
The nearly absurd irony is that journalism organizations already do
this—internally. Every editing system of any sophistication saves copies
of previous versions of articles or other content. What none of them do,
save Wikipedia, is to give the audience access to all previous versions.
Like Scott Rosenberg, I consider this a no-brainer that nevertheless will
take years to catch on, if it ever does.
If you have a WordPress blog or a Drupal site, or have created a wiki
using the standard MediaWiki software, you’re in luck. There are plug-ins (or
modules, which are essentially the same thing) for WordPress and Drupal
that will expose your changes the way Wikipedia does.
What none of these do, however, is give you the best kind of view
into what’s changed. If you use Microsoft Word and collaborate on 
Dan Gillmor 163
documents, you’ve already seen the “Track Changes” feature that gives
you a great view into what’s changed (and who’s changed it, in
collaborative settings). What we need most is a Web-based Track
Changes feature—and, beyond that, a way to see how documents have
changed over time in a more visual way. There’s a terrific opportunity
here for Web developers.
A related issue is corrections, which after all are one of the ways we
update our work (assuming we’re honest about correcting our mistakes). In
Chapter 8, when I said what I would do if I ran a news organization, I
wrote about creating a service to notify online readers, should they choose
to sign up for it, of errors we’ve learned about in our journalism. Users of
this service could choose to be notified of only errors we deemed major, or
all errors, however insignificant we believed them to be.
While I’d offer this service for more general updates as well, it
strikes me as especially critical for mistakes. By implementing such a
system, we could help prevent new viewers from seeing incorrect
information. We could also do our best to ensure that people who read
incorrect information will learn that it was wrong—and that we cared
enough to fix our errors.
Jack Shafer, Slate.com’s media writer, has been offering this service
in a technically crude way for some time. At the bottom of his column
you’ll find this offer:
Track my errors: This hand-built RSS feed will ring every time
Slate runs a “Press Box” correction. For e-mail notification of
errors in this specific column, type the word Harman in the
subject head of an e-mail message, and send it to
slate.pressbox@gmail.com.
See? This isn’t all that difficult!
Think Tank
Corporate R&D operations try to pick winners while making
relatively “safe” bets. This is the inverse.
Imagine a small team of, for lack of a better word, “connectors.”
They’ll identify interesting ideas, technologies and techniques—business
models as well as editorial innovations. Then they’ll connect these
projects with people who can help make them part of tomorrow’s
journalistic ecosystem.
Where will these projects come from? Everywhere: universities,
corporate labs, open-source repositories, startups, basements, you and me.
164 Mediactive
Part of this is about connecting dots. I take it for granted—based
on my own experiences and observations over three decades—that a
large percentage of those journalistically valuable ideas, technologies and
techniques will come from projects whose creators have no journalistic
intent. The experiments are taking place inside and outside of companies,
inside and outside the news industry (mostly outside), in Silicon Valley
and out in the larger world.
Who can help the connectors spread innovation into the larger
ecosystem? Among others:
 Traditional news organizations. This isn’t to suggest they should
not invest in some internal R&D (though most do little, if any).
However, I would suggest that they devote a bigger part of that
spending to buy or license other people’s innovations.
 Investors outside the journalism business. Angel investors and
venture capitalists think “entertainment” when they think about
media. They may be willing to place some of their high-risk,
high-reward bets on projects that meet community information
needs if they can be persuaded that they are based on serious
business models.
 Non-media enterprises. More and more corporations and nonprofits
of all stripes are creating media. If they can help support
innovations that also serve journalistic purposes, everyone wins.
If they can be persuaded of the value of applying journalistic
principles to what they produce, so much the better.
 Foundations. Some are spending a great deal of money now on
new projects, but they’d get even more leverage by supporting
the connectors.
 Individual (or small-team) media creators who can invest only
their time. An essential part of the connectors’ role would be to
identify open-source and other such projects that regular folks
or small teams can put to good community-information use.
What distinguishes the connectors?
First, they’ll understand technology at a reasonably deep level. It’s not
necessary to be a programmer, but it’s vital to know how to a) ask the right
questions of the right people, b) recognize cool technology when they see
it, and c) have a sound sense of the difference between cool and useful.
Second, they’ll need to appreciate journalism’s essential role in
society, and how the craft is changing. This means understanding 
Dan Gillmor 165
fundamental principles, of course, but also the need to turn journalism
from the lecture mode of the past to the conversational mode it needs to
become.
Third, they’ll need a broad array of contacts in the technology,
business, education, philanthropic, investor and other sectors—and the
ability to have intelligent conversations with any of them.
Finally, they’ll need to be evangelists, selling all these people not just
on the need to combine great ideas with journalism, but also the need to
take risks in new areas.
The catalyzing opportunities here are fairly amazing, if we pull this
off. It’ll require a team effort in the end, but it’s definitely worth the
effort—because the payoff for journalism could easily dwarf the
investment.
Trust, Reputation and More
In an era where we have nearly unlimited amounts of information at
our fingertips, one of the key issues is how to separate the good from the
bad, the reliable from the unreliable, the trustworthy from the
untrustworthy, the useful from the irrelevant. Unless we get this right, the
emerging diverse media ecosystem won’t work well, if at all.
I’ve long believed that we’ll need to find ways to combine
popularity—a valuable metric in itself—with reputation. This sounds
easier than it is, because evaluating reputation is enormously complex.
But whoever gets this right is going to be a huge winner in the
marketplace.
What do we mean by reputation? In this context, many things. If
someone points to a news article, for example, we have to consider
reputation at many levels. Among these:
 What “media outlet”—traditional, blog, whatever—is behind
the article? If it’s The Economist, the reputation starts at a high
level. If it’s Joe’s Blog, and I have no idea who Joe is or what he
has been doing for the past few years, the reputation starts
(much) lower.
 What is the reputation of the writer/video-maker/etc.? I
generally give a high rating to New York Times reporters, but
reputation can vary within organizations: I can name a few
Times reporters who’ve wrecked their credibility with me over
the past few years.
166 Mediactive
I gave you more detailed exploration of techniques for gauging
trustworthiness and reputation in Chapter 3. Detached measurement of
reputation is incredibly hard, though, and currently the tools for
measuring are at best crude.
In a world of emerging digital tools, however, there are glimmerings
of hope. I’ve been begging people at eBay for years—to no avail—to
make people’s reputations as buyers and sellers portable. By that I mean
people should be allowed to create a badge of some kind, with some real
data behind it, that they can post on their own work, with the data made
available in a granular way.
Of course, your eBay reputation is not an exact proxy for your
general trustworthiness, as a person or as an information creator. For one
thing, we know that people are constantly gaming eBay’s system. For
another, how you behave in buying and selling goods online doesn’t
necessarily predict how you’ll behave in other situations. Still, it may be a
useful thing to know.
Your Karma at Slashdot is another useful metric. So are the
individual users’ contributions in the collaborative filtering at the Digg
and Reddit websites for rating the news. Useful, but clearly not sufficient
by themselves to let you make big decisions about someone’s overall
integrity.
Combine a bunch of reputation systems, though, and you’re getting
somewhere—and a world of interactive data suggest at least the
possibility of finding a way to blend various measures into something
that is more useful than what we have today.
Fix the Pulitzers
The people who run the Pulitzer Prizes, undoubtedly America’s
premier journalism awards, took useful steps into the modern age in 2008
and 2009, mainly by welcoming online-only entries. They opened the
awards to people like Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo, among
many others who’d been excluded in the past due to an anachronistic
system that had admitted only print entries. We should celebrate that
progress.
But the new rules didn’t begin to address the more fundamental
issues about how journalism is changing—and they raised the question of
whether journalism prizes should exist in the first place.
Let’s answer the second question first. In general, journalism prizes
should not exist. No other profession (or craft) gives itself as many
awards as journalism. Anyone with a byline or identifiable broadcasting 
Dan Gillmor 167
face or voice almost can’t help winning something just by staying around
long enough. Worse, many of the awards are sponsored by the people
journalists cover, and some of those come with cash awards, raising all
kinds of issues about integrity.
When I’m the czar of all journalism, I’ll do away with almost every
journalism prize. Since neither will happen, I suggest that we make the
very top awards more meaningful for the digital era. Here’s some of what
I said to the Pulitzer Prize Board when it asked me to answer some
questions and offer my own suggestions about how the prizes should
recognize changes in technology and journalistic practices:
Q: In creating the Prizes, Joseph Pulitzer wanted to “elevate”
the profession of journalism. In his era, better journalism
meant better newspapers. How could we further his goal
today, given the makeup of news media and their challenges?
A: Become the top prizes for journalism of any kind. Do away
entirely with the distinction between newspapers and other
media. There’s no real alternative.
Q: Should the nature of the “newspaper” be redefined as
multimedia journalism grows and practices change? If so,
how? For example, should we include entirely online
newspapers? And what should we do with things like
videography and its impact on visual journalism?
A: You can’t define your way out of this dilemma, except in
one sense. You can define what you mean by “great
journalism,” and what you mean by “elevating the craft.”
Beyond that, everything should be fair game.
Q: Should we re-examine and possibly revise the Prizes’
journalism categories? If so, how? For example, should we
have a separate category for large multimedia packages?
Should we reconsider the idea of circulation size as a basis for
category definition—at least in some cases?
A: I’d revise the categories in some fairly dramatic ways, but I
would not make separate categories for media formats, for the
reasons I mentioned above.
I would, however, add several areas where the Pulitzers could
elevate journalism in a big way. Here are just three:
168 Mediactive
1. The digital space has many characteristics, but one is that
the journalism we create doesn’t disappear into birdcages or
pay-per-view databases. Stories and projects can accrete
influence, and be timely long beyond the traditional periods.
This is especially important when we recognize that the
manufacturing process of journalism—create something and
send it out, period—becomes obsolete in due course. Some
ideas that take this into account:
a. We’d all benefit from a prize celebrating relentless
journalism over time that led to long-term solutions of
big problems; this would require a rule change to look
back more than 12 months.
b. Along those lines, why not recognize reporting that
was ahead of its time? Whenever a major national or
international crisis becomes obvious, such as the current
credit and housing meltdowns, we can always look back
and find examples of prescient journalism that was
essentially ignored at the time. If you made that single
addition to the prizes, you’d be making a huge advance.
c. And what about journalism that has evolved? I’m
working on a book that will live and evolve mostly online,
and I guarantee it’ll be vastly better in five years than it
will be the day it’s officially published for the first time. I
can show you things that have been updated over time,
and which now are as good as journalism can be, even
though they were, early on, shadows of what they’ve
become.
2. I’d also find ways to recognize more of the finest work by
small entities that do brilliant coverage of small communities
of geography or interest. Beat reporting doesn’t fully cover
what I’m talking about here, but it’s the closest you have now.
(I’m not talking about separate prizes for big and little
organizations, however.)
3. I’d create a prize for innovation in journalism, recognizing
an advance by someone who used the collision of media and
technology to create something new and valuable to the craft.
Put all of this out for public comment, by the way. You’ll be
amazed at the great ideas others will have.
Dan Gillmor 169
Q: Should we re-evaluate the kind of journalism we honor and
the entries we encourage? For example, do we sometimes
foster journalism projects and packages that lack relevance to
everyday lives?
A: Of course you do, but that’s the nature of giving prizes. I
don’t have a great antidote for the bigness impulse. I would try
to tweak the rules and judging to favor things that genuinely
lead to a better world. I don’t have any obvious ways to
achieve this, of course….
Q: Should the Board itself be changed? Should we alter the
mix of journalists and academics? Should we expand the
Board’s total size? (The Board now has 17 voting members, 4
of whom can be non-journalists. The dean of the journalism
school and the Pulitzer administrator are non-voting members
of the Board.)
A: Yes, change the board, in significant ways if you adopt any
of the ideas I’ve suggested. (It seems large enough now.) The
current board members are superb representatives of the 20thcentury
manufactured-newspaper model of journalism, and
people of that stature and accomplishment should remain part
of the mix. But I’d include some very different kinds of folks,
who may have a wider vision of the craft.
Get Policy Right
As the business model of journalism has fractured, some big news
organizations, their corporate parents and a host of well-meaning
observers have latched onto an alarming, anti-capitalistic notion:
government (read: taxpayer) help. In 2009 and 2010, the Federal Trade
Commission held several workshops entitled “How Will Journalism
Survive the Internet Age?,” whose stated purpose was “to explore how
the Internet has affected journalism.”
This seemed to indicate that the nation’s scam artists, monopolists
and market-riggers had all gone into hibernation, during the worst
economic crisis since the Great Depression. How else could the FTC
have the breathing room it needs to intercede in an arena where its role
is, at best, unclear?
The FTC justified its intervention in a Federal Register Notice that
observed, in a promising start, that the Internet has created unparalleled
possibilities. The commission could have stopped there, and not 
170 Mediactive
bothered to hold the workshop. It could have recognized that we’re in
the early days of a transition from one set of business models (most of
which have not been very competitive) to an emerging, hypercompetitive
sphere.
But the commission staff and many speakers found much to fret
about, spurred in large part by the newspaper industry’s incessant
whining. (Could it also have been influenced by the fact that the FTC
chairman is married to a Washington Post opinion writer? No, this
obviously had absolutely no bearing on anything.) Chief among the
threats was the erosion of the advertising-based business model.
The FTC notice, quoting several economists, asserted bizarrely that
“public affairs reporting may indeed be particularly subject to market
failure.”
Market failure? What about the market failure—which, as far as I
can tell, never got any attention from a succession of FTC people during
the past half-century—that resulted in the the media monopolies and
oligopolies that dominated that period? Their public affairs journalism
was, for the most part, a modest spinoff of the extortionate advertising
prices they charged when they had near-absolute market power to charge
anything they wished. Only when there’s real competition, it seems, does
the FTC get interested.
We do not need government subsidies aimed specifically at
journalism. That’s not to say taxpayers should stay entirely clear of
Internet deployment; in fact, a policy leading to widespread, open
broadband access for all Americans is the single place where government
intervention in media makes sense, with free speech implications as well
as financial ones.
As noted earlier in this volume, we should remember the indirect
subsidies of low postal rates for print publications, giveaways of publicly
owned airwaves (spectrum) to broadcasters, the odious “Newspaper
Preservation Act” granting partial antitrust immunity to community
newspapers, and a variety of other special favors the news business has
received over the years. Some of those were targeted directly at news
organizations; others were more general and defensible.
On the table now are such fixes as changing the copyright laws to
make life more difficult for online aggregators, changing antitrust laws to
give journalism-related businesses even more antitrust immunity, direct
subsidies and more. All are terrible ideas.
There’s only one subsidy that makes sense; only one that wouldn’t
put government meddling squarely into the practice of journalism—an
inevitable result of the direct subsidies being pushed by well-meaning but 
Dan Gillmor 171
misguided media thinkers. It’s a subsidy for bandwidth: getting true
broadband Internet access to as many people as possible, as some other
nations in Europe and Asia have done.
The precedent in this case is the right one. Taxpayer-assisted
infrastructure—especially the postal system and low rates for sending
publications—helped create the newspaper business, and enabled a lot of
other commerce. Let’s bring that logic forward to the early 21st century,
and enable high-speed Internet access for all Americans, and a
communications infrastructure for all competitors.
Networking Market Failure Looms
As it is, we’re moving toward a market failure of frightening
proportions in digital networking, as the telecom industry clamps
down, or threatens to, on people’s ability to use Internet connections
as they see fit. We’re moving toward a media business consolidation
that would terrify any real champion of open markets: a cable-phone
duopoly.
This brings up the topic of network neutrality: the idea that carriers
should not discriminate against one content provider in favor of another.
All Internet service providers already manage their network traffic
in some ways, such as spam filtering. One reason I worry about new rules
enforcing neutrality is the law of unintended consequences. If we allow
the carriers to make special deals to favor the content of companies that
pay more for special access to end users, rather than letting you and me
decide what we want to use, we’re heading for major trouble.
The danger signs are growing that we’re moving fast toward a world
where the carriers cut deals with favored providers. They’ve made it clear
that they want to do that, and they insist they have the right. If they win
this battle, you can write off the kind of robust and diverse
media/journalism ecosystem we’ve been discussing in this book—
because upstarts will tend to be frozen out by the mega-players.
This is why it was so worrisome when Google and Verizon, the
huge phone and Internet company, announced in August 2010 some
principles about network access that could, if enacted, be the end of any
hope of network neutrality.
They paid lip service to net neutrality, but then offered several
caveats. Neutrality would apply only to the “wireline” portion of the
Internet, such as DSL and cable connections, and only to what we have
now. Their proposal would, they said, promote the expansion of new
services that would go beyond anything we have today. Supposedly, these 
172 Mediactive
new services could not be designed to be end runs around net neutrality;
they would have to be genuinely new.
What’s the problem, then? It’s this: We cannot trust Verizon or
other carriers, or Google for that matter, to follow through in ways that
are truly in the interest of the kind of open networks the nation needs.
If Google CEO Eric Schmidt was telling the truth when he said his
company’s overwhelming focus will remain on the public Internet—for
example, promising that YouTube will remain there—that’s great. I have
no reason to disbelieve him, and Google’s track record to date is strong
on this issue. But plans change, managements change, and corporate
strategies change.
Meanwhile, Google and Verizon went backwards in a big way,
arguing that data services provided by mobile-phone companies
shouldn’t be subject to neutrality rules, given the constrained bandwidth
on current mobile networks. As Susan Crawford, professor at Cardozo
Law School of Yeshiva University in New York and an expert on all
things Internet, explains: “That’s a huge hole, given the growing
popularity of wireless services and the recent suggestion by the [FCC]
that we may not have a competitive wireless marketplace.”
For Verizon’s part, the acceptance of what sounded like fairly
serious neutrality rules on current wire-line networks was welcome. But I
see the rest as a Trojan Horse. Verizon and other carriers have every
incentive, based on their legacies, to push network upgrade investments
into the parallel Internet, not the public one.
With one exception, the carriers have all but abandoned their push to
bring to the U.S. the kind of wired-line bandwidth that other nations—
Japan, South Korea, France and Sweden come immediately to mind—enjoy.
Verizon has all but stopped building out its fast fiber-optic network to
homes, leaving Comcast as the provider that is most ardently boosting
connection speeds via its cable lines. (Even Comcast’s fast speeds are
nothing special next to what carriers in those other nations have provided,
not to mention initiatives elsewhere as the U.S. falls further behind.)
So when Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg said “We have to be
flexible,” my immediate thought was “Uh-oh.”
The right way forward is to have sufficient bandwidth that all of us,
citizens and corporations alike, can do pretty much anything we choose
using public networks—a true broadband infrastructure is the basis for
all communications.
Instead, the game is on by powerful corporations to create a parallel
Internet that’s just another version of television. Let’s hope they won’t
get away with it.

Reward Systems
A fierce and fascinating debate broke out over the cover photo on
Time magazine’s April 27, 2009, print edition. Time paid a pittance for the
picture of a glass jar semi-filled with coins, for a story on Americans’
newly frugal ways in the wake of the financial meltdown. The amount
was much less than what big magazines normally pay for cover art, and
that made a lot of professional photographers furious.
They should get over it. But they and their gifted-amateur and parttimer
peers—especially the ones capturing breaking news events—should
start agitating for some better marketplaces than the ones available today.
As I noted in Chapter 4, I’m not a fan of a system that tells people they
should be contributing their work to profitable corporations for nothing
more than a pat on the back.
The freelance system of the past was inefficient. If you had a great
picture, your options were limited. But as the Time photo suggests, the
marketplace in the Internet era has changed irrevocably. Someone with a
camera (probably part of a phone) almost always will be in a position to
capture relevant still photos and/or, increasingly, videos of newsworthy
events. We’ll have more valuable pictures, not less, and production values
will take second place to authenticity and timeliness.
This is also becoming more and more the case for what journalists
call “feature photography.” As anyone who spends any serious time on
Flickr already knows, amateur photographers are doing incredible work.
Few of them can match the consistent quality of what the pros do, but
they don’t have to. Every one of us is capable of capturing one supremely
memorable image. Whatever you’re looking for, you can find it on Flickr
or other photo sites, including the stock-photos service where Robert
Lam listed the picture that ended up on Time’s cover. According to a
conversation thread on the Model Mayhem photo community site, which
includes some strenuous objections from pro photographers, Time paid
Lam $30 for the photo.
It does strike me as absurd that a huge magazine with huge
circulation can get an image like Lam’s for so little money. But that was
his choice, and it was Time’s choice to take advantage of the low price he
was asking.
Just as some people gladly take the New York Times’s absurdly low
pay when their freelance articles make it into the paper’s news and op-ed
pages, some photographers gladly sell their work for peanuts to Time.
They have their own reasons, which can range from getting valuable
exposure—so they can (try to) charge more for subsequent work—to not

needing the higher rates that staffers and more famous people can
demand.
This gets trickier, it seems to me, when it comes to breaking news,
where news organizations derive enormous benefits from having the
right image or video at the right time, and too frequently get it for less
than peanuts. Indeed, practically every news organization now invites its
audience to submit pictures and videos, in return for which the
submitters typically get zip.
Which is why we need a more robust marketplace than any I’ve
seen so far—namely, a real-time auction system.
How would a real-time auction system work? The flow, I’d imagine,
would go like this: Photographer captures breaking news event on video
or audio, and posts the work to the auction site. Potential buyers,
especially media companies, get to see watermarked thumbnails and then
start bidding. A time limit is enforced in each case. The winning bid goes
to the photographer, minus a cut to the auction service.
The premium, then, would be on timeliness and authenticity. One
or two images/videos would be likely to command relatively high prices,
and everything else would be worth considerably less.
Eventually, someone will do this kind of business—which could
also be useful for eyewitness text accounts of events. For the sake of the
citizen journalists who are not getting what they deserve for their work, I
hope it’s sooner rather than later.
For print, an auction system is also needed, but the timeliness is less
critical. A British startup is planning, as I write this, to launch a service
called “Newsrupt,” aimed more at editors than reporters. I hope it’s the
first of many such ventures.
Identity, Accountability
I said earlier that I strongly encourage people to use their real
names in online conversations. But I do recognize the need for
anonymity in certain situations, and I would never support the toofrequent
calls for its outright banning.
My reason for preferring real names is accountability. The quality
and trustworthiness of what we say and do is enhanced by our
willingness to be accountable.
There are middle grounds between absolute name verification and
anonymity. Online, we can use pseudonyms—made-up names—that are
attached to a single e-mail address. Many online comment systems insist
on registration using this method.

After all, who are you? Actually, you are many people, at least in the
sense of how you deal with others in your life. You show one part of
yourself to your family. You show another to your colleagues at work.
And you show still another to your friends outside of home and work.
The systems for pseudonymity are still crude, though, and subject
to gaming by spammers and others who want to pollute our experiences.
They need to improve.
We also need to create online identities for commercial purposes—
identities that guarantee merchants that we can pay but that shield all
other information from being sucked into their computers. The
technology exists to make this possible, but it hasn’t been put into the
marketplace in any consistent or robust way.
Media Literacy
I discussed this in the previous chapter, but I’ll make the pitch
again: We need, in America and the world, to ensure that children grow
up with the kinds of media skills they mostly don’t have today.
Then we need to make those skills part of a general lifelong learning
process.
The principles I outlined in Chapter 2 are a good place to start. But
we should not stop with helping people become better consumers; it’s
essential, as I’ve said repeatedly in this book, to focus on the creation side
of the equation, too.
Those skills should add up to something larger: critical thinking.
The way to have an informed citizenry is by having citizens who think
for themselves.
Continue the Conversation
We’ve reached the end of this book, apart from the epilogue. But
we’re nowhere near the end of the conversation we all need to have, and
continue, about our media future.
I hope you’ll stop by Mediactive.com. Tell us about resources
you’ve discovered that will help us all, and join the conversations we’re
having there about these issues.
More importantly, have these conversations where you live. I hope
what you’ve read here will spark a few of them.
