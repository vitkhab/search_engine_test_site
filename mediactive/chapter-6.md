# Chapter 6
Tools and Tactics for Trusted Creators
The tools of digital media creation are becoming ubiquitous, certainly
in the developed world and increasingly on a global scale as well. They
encompass such a wide variety of technologies and methods that I
could spend this entire volume just talking about the ones you can use
right now—and by the time you finished reading, there would be new
ones.
So, in this chapter we’ll look in a high-level way at how to make
your own media. As always, we’ll extend and amplify at
mediactive.com.
It’s especially useful to know the most widely used tools and
techniques and to understand why people are so excited about some of
the emerging ones. Our teenagers are using most of these tools already,
especially social networks and mobile texting, and in many families
younger children are being immersed in electronic gadgets of all kinds.
(Like all tools, digital ones can be used for good or bad purposes, and
with positive and negative consequences for the user; I’ll address that in
another chapter.) And if you’re reading this book, chances are you’re
using at least some media creation tools.
I’ve arranged this chapter’s sections in order from the most basic to
the more complex—that is, starting with the ones you’re most likely to
be using already and moving along a path to the tools and techniques that
demand more expertise.
There’s no way to list, much less discuss, all of the available
technologies and services. I’m focusing here on a few that strike me as
the main ones where people are already participating and contributing in
trusted ways, including several that require a more serious commitment
of your time.
None of these is all that difficult, but I recognize that everyone has
a personal limit. So when you reach yours, as you read on, it’s fine to stop
there and continue to the next chapter. If you do that, I hope you’ll come
back sometime and read what you’ve skipped.

Simple Text: Mail Lists and Discussion Groups
In this day of video, audio, mashups and all kinds of advanced
media forms, we sometimes forget the value of plain old text. That can
be a mistake, because text is easy to take in and, for most people, easier
to create than linear media like videos.
You don’t even have to be a blogger to use text to great effect in
communities of all kinds. Even a simple email list can be a great way to
keep people in touch, and to pass around valuable information. If you
can pull people to your blog, it’s great for disseminating ideas, but often
you’ll get more attention by posting a brief message to an appropriate
mailing list already frequented by the people you want to reach.
There are thousands and thousands of mail lists, message boards
and other kinds of systems of this sort. They exist for conversation and
to provide information, and they can be amazingly valuable. They’re
designed for easy participation. Some allow anonymous posting; others
require a sign-up with a valid email address in order to deter bad
behavior. Although some go even further and require each mail to be
checked by a moderator, this kind of gatekeeping is rarely used anymore
because it holds up discussion.
Of course, it’s fine to lurk in the background, reading without
posting; in fact, a general rule on forums is that you should read for at
least a couple of days before you add your voice, to get a sense of the
culture and what’s acceptable to post. Ultimately, you’ll get the most out
of these forums by joining in. The more you know about a topic, the
more you can help others understand it, too. No matter who you are, you
know more than enough about something to be a valuable participant.
Forums and mail lists are also simple to create yourself. It’s
especially easy at big Internet sites like Google Groups and Yahoo!
Groups. If you don’t already have an account, just create one. Then
create a group, and you’re off to the races.
The limits of running a group or mail list via Google or Yahoo!
become fairly obvious once you’ve spent enough time there. You can
move up to more sophisticated forum software—there are literally
dozens of products and services to choose from—but going this route
does add several layers of complexity.
I’ve been on mail lists and forums of various kinds for years. Some
are just entertaining, but others have serious value as community
information providers. For example, our former neighborhood in a
northern-California city—a few square blocks with several hundred
homes—was served by a community website that offered basic 
Dan Gillmor 79
information about the area. But the more valuable online information
source was a Yahoo! Groups message board where residents discussed
local news. One day, someone posted a message saying that the tap water
had gotten cloudy. Someone else noticed the same thing. Not too many
hours later, we found out the scoop: According to a resident who called
the city utilities department, repairs to the system were causing the
cloudiness, but it was not at all dangerous to anyone’s health; the poster
of this message also linked to a page on the city’s website explaining the
situation.
This incident was not nearly important enough to have been of
interest to the (formerly) big daily newspaper in Silicon Valley, my old
employer. As far as I know it didn’t even make the weekly serving our
town. But it was real, serious news in our neighborhood, as were other
messages over the years letting folks know about local break-ins and
vandalism.*
Social Networks: Facebook and More
In mid-2010, Facebook announced it had reached an amazing
milestone: 500 million signups worldwide. You may well be one of them.
Almost without exception, my students are. So am I.
I should say at the outset that while I have immense respect for the
brilliance of the Facebook founder and team, I’m not a huge fan of
Facebook itself, for reasons I’ll explain in more detail later in the book;
suffice it to say, for now, that I don’t like Facebook’s ever-morphing
privacy policies and I especially worry that it’s creating a walled garden
that diminishes the rest of the online world. But it’s hugely popular, in
part because it does what it does so seamlessly and, for users, in a helpful
way. Whatever I think of the service, it’s the preeminent social
network—MySpace and LinkedIn are a considerable distance behind in
sheer numbers—and it’s developed into an impressive ecosystem that
clearly has staying power.
To create an ecosystem, Facebook encouraged third parties to use
its software platform to create other products and services within the
Facebook service itself: everything from posting pictures to sharing travel

*Information created at the “hyper-local” level, as some call the geography, takes a
contrarian twist from the old adage, “It’s not news when dog bites man, but it is news
when man bites dog.” That’s true enough if the news provider is a big-city paper or TV
station. But “dog bites man” is definitely news if it happens on your street, more so if
the dog bit your next-door neighbor—and especially if it was your dog.
80 Mediactive
plans to playing online games, and on and on. You can spend a lot of
time inside Facebook and get a lot out of the experiences.
The updating mechanism at services of this kind, called a “wall” at
Facebook, is in its own way a news service, where the news and
observations come from people you know or have “friended” there. The
value of what you read (and see in photos and videos) depends, of
course, on how useful or entertaining you find what others post. But
purely for social interaction, there’s a lot to be said for using social
networks as a way to stay in touch.
Should you “friend” everyone who asks? That is, should you agree
to share your private information with other people more or less
indiscriminately? Definitely not. Most people online, as in the physical
world, are good. But enough are not that you should be at least
somewhat cautious in how you approach social networks.
We need to take privacy issues extremely seriously. After Facebook
made what I considered a dramatic change in its policies, I decided to
quit and start over, as I’ll explain in Chapter 9. And as I’ll also discuss in
the same chapter, privacy is at the core of what I hope will be changing
customs in an always-connected age.
Again, while the rise of Facebook has been meteoric, and wellearned,
it’s hardly the only social network. MySpace has a huge number
of users, and while it no longer has its former cachet it remains highly
popular, especially when used for its primary purpose: music discovery
and promotion. I don’t visit it much, but researcher danah boyd has
observed that MySpace still is one of the most widely used networks,
second only to Facebook.
I use LinkedIn for much of my social-networking interaction. It’s
aimed at the business community, but it’s a terrific network for finding
people who share your vocational or professional interests. I tell my
students, nearly all of whom have Facebook accounts, that they should
have LinkedIn accounts when they head out into the job market. (I and
many others have had great success using LinkedIn to recruit new
colleagues.)
You can create your own social network without all that much
difficulty, too. Ning.com does this brilliantly, with many of the best
features of the big networks available out of the virtual box. I’ve used
Ning for university classes, to keep students informed of events in class,
and found one of its best features to be the ability to make the network
entirely private among its members, invisible to the outside world. (As
we’ll discuss later, though, it’s always best to assume that anything you
create online for someone else—anyone else—to look at may someday 
Dan Gillmor 81
escape out to the rest of the world.) Ning started off as a free service. It
now charges, but I still recommend it highly.
Even blogging platforms, discussed in the next section, are
becoming more like social networks. For example, the people behind
WordPress have created BuddyPress, an add-on that brings social
networking capabilities to the blogging system. It’s what I’m using now
for classes, and while it doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles (yet) of
other social networks, it works just fine for our purposes, even allowing
us to keep things private.
Blogging
A blog is a series of updates in reverse chronological order, with the
newest material at the top. That’s it. Simple, no?
Yet blogging is a term that encompasses any number of forms; it
can be turned to a variety of purposes, as millions of people around the
globe have discovered. Blogging has become one of the most preferred
ways for people to post news, opinions and, yes, even what they’ve had
for breakfast as they write from their basements in their pajamas—the
latter a capsule description of the way some people like to deride citizen
media.
Blogging providers and services abound. The “big 3” services for
individuals are:
Blogger: a free hosting service owned by Google that’s probably
the least flexible of the pack but also probably the simplest to use.
Google let Blogger languish for a time, but it has been improving the
service lately.
WordPress: currently my blogging software of choice. WordPress
has both hosted (free and paid) and self-serve options where you install
the software on a computer owned by you or your Web hosting service.
It also has a large variety of “plug-ins” that let you extend and customize
what you can post and how people can view and use it.
TypePad: a mostly paid hosting service from Movable Type, a
company that has focused more and more on the business market.
Posterous: aimed at folks who prefer visuals and short updates to
lots of text. Along with a similar service called Tumblr, it’s one of the
faster-growing sites in the genre.
The main thing to understand about any of these blogging services
is their convenience. You can create a blog in about five minutes, and
later you can make it pretty much as simple or elaborate as you want.
82 Mediactive
If you have a passion for something, blogging is a natural outlet.
The best bloggers have several things in common:
 They write with a genuine, conversational human voice, more
like a letter to a friend than formal journalism. A blog is not a
press release machine, or at least shouldn’t be.
 They invite conversation. This trait isn’t universal: Some
extremely popular blogs don’t allow comments, for reasons that
seem appropriate to the people who run those sites. But I
strongly advise that you not just allow comments, but encourage
them.
 They link out to other sources. They don’t just tell what the
author knows or thinks, but point readers to useful material
from others as well.
Should you write infrequent but long posts, or frequent but pithy
ones, or something in between? My answer is: Yes. Do whatever you feel is
best, not what someone prescribes. (If you want to get lots of traffic, or
visits from other people, more frequent updates are generally a good idea.)
For years and years, the question has kept coming up: Is blogging
journalism? We may as well ask whether writing on paper is journalism.
The answer, of course, is that most blogging is not journalism, but some
blogging is. In short, as blogging pioneer (among many other
accomplishments) Dave Winer has pointed out, blogs are tools to be
used in any number of different ways. Let’s agree never to ask this
question again, okay?
Twitter (Microblogging)
The traditional media pick a Big New Thing in Technology all the
time, and in 2009 it was Twitter. This time, the traditional media got it
right.
Twitter is a “microblogging” service that lets you post messages of
up to 140 characters in length, called “tweets.” That’s not as short as a
typical newspaper headline, but it’s not long enough for more than a
basic thought.
Yet the very limitation of Twitter—combined with absolutely
brilliant positioning by the company—has turned it into what has aptly
been termed the “nervous system of the Web.” The flow of information
on the service is diverse, of course, given the millions of users; but it’s
also useful, not just entertaining.
Dan Gillmor 83
Twitter users soon find that almost every event they care about—if
they are following the right people—is first mentioned in the
“tweetstream.” Search engines aren’t as good at capturing real-time
information flow, though they’re getting better at it (and increasingly they
include Twitter in their own results.) Of course, the value of this stream
of data depends as well on whether you’re paying close attention; it’s easy
to miss things that scroll by. With third-party Twitter-management
software, discussed briefly below, you can set up searches to keep track
of things you care about.
I use Twitter both as a creator and a reader; it’s an essential part
of my daily media. I use it as an alert system to get tips and early
warnings, and to keep an eye on what people I respect think is
important. I follow the “Tweets” (Twitter postings) of about 350
people and organizations. I’ve selected and organized them carefully,
looking for rich information from the relative few rather than a fire
hose from the many. Many of the people I follow are involved in the
media. I post frequently as well, and as of this writing have about
11,000 followers—a decent number, but not remotely in the ballpark
of the most avidly followed people or services.
The main reason Twitter has become so popular is that the people
behind it—including Evan Williams, co-founder of Blogger (see a
pattern?)—have made the service the center of an ecosystem. They’ve
made it easy for other people to build applications and services on the
tweets of the millions of Twitter users, in all kinds of ways.* Third-party
applications that manage your Twitter stream are invaluable for
organizing the people you follow and creating searches that you can
check from time to time.
If you have a blog, you can use Twitter to build the audience by
tweeting to point to blog postings you think are particularly interesting. I
don’t recommend tweeting about every blog post, because your Twitter
followers may well grow tired of this kind of self-promotion when they
can just as easily get an RSS feed from your blog.
In general, the best newsworthy Tweets contain hyperlinks to
something else. When someone I follow because I like her work suggests
I look at something related to her expertise and makes it sound
interesting in her brief description, I tend to click through and check it
out. I can’t overstate the value of Twitter when used in this manner.

* I’m an investor in one of the third-party companies creating software for Twitter
users, called Seesmic. By some reckonings, the most popular Twitter client application is
TweetDeck. Most are free or low-cost, so try them until you find one you like.
84 Mediactive
Because of the 140-character limit, Twitter has spurred the use of
URL-shortening services such as bit.ly and is.gd, which shorten the Web
addresses you submit to a Twitter-appropriate lengths. However, the use
of these services has raised a number of questions, including the
permanence of the links and how search engines will handle valuable
links that actually send you to something else, as well as security
questions.
Audio: Podcasts and More
We are, in some ways, what we listen to. I love music, and I love
the spoken word.
We’re in the early days of an audio revolution. Other digital media
are also undergoing rapid change, but audio has a special nature of its
own.
Whether you listen to the radio or podcasts or audio of other kinds,
there is a special quality to listening. You are forced, in a good way, to
use your imagination. When I listen to a news program on National
Public Radio I am filling in gaps in my mind, visualizing the parts I’m not
seeing.
Podcasting is the most important of the emerging audio methods, at
least in the context of news and information. The easiest way to think of
podcasts is as audio blogs: episodic, available over the Internet via
syndication, and displaying the newest postings first. (I’d bet that most
people find new podcasts through searches and links from other sites,
however.)
As with blogs, the variety of podcasts is enormous. The most
popular podcasting (and music) delivery system is Apple’s iTunes store,
but you can find podcasts in many other ways as well. Also as with with
blogs, you can host your audio files yourself, or you can find services that
will host them on their computers (something I recommend for both
audio and video).
The software tools you need to create good podcasts come with
every new desktop or laptop computer. Apple’s GarageBand software
has podcast-specific features, for example. There’s also a huge amount of
free or low-cost software available online, if you decide to get more
sophisticated about your recordings.
To join the audio movement, you should have a decent headset
with a microphone for recording and playback at home or in the office.
If you’re interviewing people in the field, you should consider buying a
decent external microphone and audio recorder, although modern digital 
Dan Gillmor 85
cameras usually let you record audio and video, and today’s smart phones
can do what you need if you don’t mind not-so-great audio and picture
quality.
Although an audio news show or segment—compiled material that
is edited before distribution—is considerably more complex to create
than most blog posts, you don’t have to be an audio or news-radio pro to
create a useful podcast. Sometimes a recording of a conversation is all
you need: Imagine talk radio, democratized. One of the most interesting
podcast series around is called “Rebooting the News”; it was originated
by blog pioneer Dave Winer and New York University journalism
professor Jay Rosen (both friends of mine), who ruminate—often with
guests, including me on one occasion—on the state of news. Their
weekly series, far from getting stale, has only grown more interesting over
time.
Visual: Photos and Videos
Sooner or later—though more quickly in the developed world—
almost everyone will be walking around with a camera capable of
recording both still photos and video—the one in his or her mobile
phone. It’s already getting difficult to buy a phone that doesn’t at least
take photos, and video recording capabilities are becoming more
common, too. Meanwhile, digital still and video cameras continue to sell
by the millions, and their capabilities improve at the steady pace we’ve
come to expect from modern digital technology.
What kind of equipment should you use? I tend to agree with Chase
Jarvis, who says “the best camera is the one that’s with you”—he’s
written a book and iPhone app, and created an online community, to
reinforce this point. Without the camera, there’s no picture or video.
If you take lots of pictures, you may well want to share some or all
of them with others, not just keep them on your own computer. If so,
look at online services such as Flickr, a Yahoo! operation that takes in
some 750 photos every second. If you’re going to be a heavy user of
Flickr and other such services, you’ll need to consider signing up for a
paid account that gives you more storage and upload capacity.
If it’s 10 times harder to create an excellent audio report than a
piece of text, it may be another 10 times harder, or at least more timeconsuming,
to create an excellent video. But even here, the ease of
production is rapidly improving, and younger people who have grown up
with video as part of their routine media toolkits are showing older folks
(like me) new tricks.
86 Mediactive
A video doesn’t have to be elaborate or fancy, though. I tend to
create videos for two main purposes: interviews and scene-setting.
Neither is a full-blown production. Interviews are simple: Just set up a
camera (and an external microphone, if you have one), and have at it. By
scene-setting I mean using the video as a window into your subject.
Suppose you’re interviewing a businessperson for a blog posting. You
can shoot a quick video of his or her office, so your own audience can
easily visualize the place you visited. This takes no special shooting or
editing skills, but still has real value.
What should you do with the videos? Most people store them on
someone else’s site, commonly YouTube. There are good reasons to do
this: notably, the ease of uploading and the willingness of Google, which
owns YouTube, to cover the considerable costs of making these files
available on the Internet. (Do keep a backup copy of everything you
create, though!) YouTube is so popular that as of November 2010 people
were uploading 35 hours of video per minute.
Of course, as with social networks and other tools, the most
popular sites are not the only ones around. I don’t necessarily
recommend YouTube for videos, because it still hasn’t given users an
easy way to make videos available under the Creative Commons
copyright license, which encourages wider sharing of digital material. I do
recommend Blip.TV for that purpose; the service specifically creates a
default setting for Creative Commons licensing. (Flickr also has a
Creative Commons option, one reason I still recommend it.)
Mashups, APIs, Tagging and More
Stop reading for a second if you’re holding the printed edition of
this book. Fire up your Web browser and look at the “Tunisian Prison
Map” online at http://www.nawaat.org/tunisianprisonersmap. Click on
any of the pointers in the map, and it will take you deeper into a
repository of information about Tunisia’s human rights abuses. The
map’s lead creator, Sami Ben Gharbia, pulled data from a variety of
sources and used Google Maps to help illustrate what he found. It’s
brilliant work, and in a good cause.
The Tunisian map is an example of a mashup—a combination of
data and Web services that could not have existed before the Web 2.0 era.
It relies on a technology called the Application Programming Interface
(API). APIs are used to make connections between different websites and
services, by allowing one to interoperate with others. The electrical socket
in a wall is, in effect, an API to devices that use electricity.
Dan Gillmor 87
You don’t have to have a lot of experience with technology to
create your own mashup. Google Maps and its competitors let you put
virtual pins on maps and then annotate them with your own information.
Some news organizations have done something similar; for example, the
Bakersfield Californian newspaper put up a map and asked readers to
pinpoint the locations of potholes in the city streets. You could do the
same in your own neighborhood (let your city government officials
know, because they’re the ones who can get the holes filled!). Even easier
for this purpose than Google Maps for beginners is CitySourced.com,
which is specifically aimed at improving local services.
Mashups are fundamentally about data, but some of the best ones
are also about visualizing that data. Numbers, dates and the like don’t tell
you much by themselves, but when you combine them with visual
techniques they start to sing a tune we can all understand. One of my
favorites in this genre is a video timeline of Wal-Mart deployments across
the continental U.S., with dots on the map starting in a small city in
Arkansas and ultimately spreading across the nation in a view that is
unpleasantly reminiscent of an epidemic.
The Web is loaded with excellent resources for creating mashups.
We have a list on the Mediactive site, but I recommend starting at a site
called, logically, Programmable Web, which offers a great “how to” on
creating your own mashup. It starts with “Pick a subject” and goes into
detail from there.
Content-Management Systems
What if your Blogger.com or WordPress.com blog isn’t enough?
What if you want to create a more sophisticated information site or
service, offering community features and a variety of bells and whistles
not available in typical blog software?
You may have just crossed over into the CMS zone.
CMS stands for content-management system, a term that describes a
variety of software and Web services that do what the name suggests:
management of various kinds of content. There’s a CMS behind every
major news site. (To be clear, WordPress and other blog platforms are
content-management systems, too; I’ve separated them here because
what follows ups the ante on flexibility, as well as complexity. But I’m
increasingly impressed with how powerful WordPress has become even
in this category.)
Content-management systems typically combine two major
components. The first is a database: usually a free (open source) package 
88 Mediactive
called MySQL. That’s where everything you create—postings, comments,
pictures, etc.—resides. The CMS itself is software that: a) helps you
create the material that goes into the database; b) pulls data out of that
database to create Web pages for display on computer screens, phones
and other devices; and c) helps you manage your website.
As noted, hosted blogging software is a form of CMS, too: It just
manages the content in a few specific ways, giving you less flexibility in
return for greater ease of use (and ease of management for the company
hosting the blogs).
Setting up your own CMS is not trivial. Unless you are technically
adept, you should find a Web hosting company that will help you create
your CMS, or find a partner who knows how, or even hire someone to
do it for you, or both. Trust me on this.
You can choose among literally hundreds of CMS packages. Check
the Mediactive website for a list of sites that can help you find and use a
system that will fit your needs. Two systems of note are:
Drupal: Probably the best known open-source (free to
download, use and modify), multi-purpose CMS. (Joomla!, another
CMS of this genre, has a large and passionate following as well; in
fact, it’s more popular than Drupal in some places.) Drupal is a highly
modular system: you can plug in all kinds of add-ons to tweak and
customize your site. It has a large community of users and developers,
a big plus if you’re going to be making significant changes to the core
features (you almost certainly will). But Drupal can also be an
extremely frustrating system, partly due to that very flexibility. My
own relationship with Drupal is very much in the love-hate category.
You’ll find Drupal at http://drupal.org.
MediaWiki: We discussed Wikipedia in an earlier chapter. Did you
know that the software used to run the site is freely available? It’s also
getting more powerful all the time. The MediaWiki.org site , which hosts
the software of the same name, is itself a Wiki, of course, and it offers
downloads and thorough instructions on how to use it. Just because it’s a
Wiki doesn’t mean you have to let anyone edit any page; you can allow
only certain people to make changes.
Mobile, the Emerging Frontier
My current mobile phone is called the “Nexus One,” and it’s way,
way more than just a phone. It’s a mobile computing device, combining
phone, camera, camcorder, GPS location, Web and multimedia services,
and lots more.
Dan Gillmor 89
It’s far from the only option out there, of course. Apple’s iPhone
has been a huge hit, as has its iPad tablet computer, and other
manufacturers offer highly capable “smart phones” as well. Mobile
computing using these devices is a huge part of our future.
The explosion of highly sophisticated mobile devices is still in a
relative infancy. Even at this early stage, however, the mobile revolution
has changed pretty much everything we knew about our relationship to
technology. The latest mobile devices have these characteristics:
 They’re always connected (in theory, at any rate). You can
communicate wherever you are, in a variety of ways, including
via text, audio, photo, video and more.
 They know where they are. Modern devices have built-in GPS,
or global positioning, to within a few meters. Some also have
compasses, so they know what direction their cameras are
facing. If you’re like me, the single most valuable mobile
application I use is Google Maps.
 They are creating not just the data you designate, but a host of
other information that (if you choose) is always attached to
what you create. This means, for example, that if you take a
picture and send it to, say, Flickr, the photo-sharing service
automatically checks to see if there’s location information and,
if so, puts the picture into a map.
Software developers are off to the races to come up with novel
ways to use the capabilities of these devices. One of the most intriguing
uses is what’s called “augmented reality,” in which you use the phone’s
camera to look at your surroundings, and then have those surroundings
annotated with whatever other people have posted online about the
area—everything from the location (plus patron reviews) of the local
steakhouse to the location of the nearest cardiologist, with turn-by-turn
directions to both.
So far, smart phones have been most valuable as devices we use
to get information. One of my favorite tests is to scan the bar code of
an item in a store and then check, using the device’s various
capabilities, where else it’s for sale in the neighborhood or online, and
at what price.
You can easily imagine the journalism potential. For example, it
would be easy to map graffiti (or potholes, or just about anything else) in
your city, annotated with pictures. My students created a map and photo
gallery of local art galleries during a Phoenix “First Friday Art Walk,” a 
90 Mediactive
monthly event when people from all over the metropolitan area converge
on the downtown visual arts scene.
The latest and perhaps most intriguing use of the new mobile
devices is combining location awareness with social networking. Not only
have Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, MySpace and other social systems
moved swiftly to these platforms, but a host of new services are emerging
as well. Some, such as Foursquare and Gowalla, invite users to announce
their locations and then see what’s happening in the neighborhood, and
who else is there.
By the time this appears in print, of course, we’ll have heard about
dozens or scores of new mobile devices and applications, each promising
(and possibly delivering) more than what came before. We’ll keep an eye
on them on the Mediactive website, in the context of media creation.
As with social networking on PCs, and with all of the content you
create, there are privacy issues attached to mobility—some that are much
more troubling than anything we’ve encountered in the past. I’ll discuss
this more in Chapter 9.
Terms of Service, Etc.
When you register to use an online service, you are almost always
confronted with a checkbox you must click in order to proceed. Almost
everyone checks it, but almost no one reads the Terms of Service to
which they’re agreeing.
My overarching goal in this chapter (and this book as a whole) is
to help you jump in and join the journalistic conversation. But you can’t
ignore the legalities, especially if you’re planning to create media that
may have a commercial aspect. Some people, including me, refuse to
use certain popular sites—or take extra care not to use them for any
significant work or play—because of restrictions they impose or how
the sites might use the data posted there. I put Facebook into this
category.
I strongly suggest that you do read the privacy policies and terms of
service on the sites you use. I also hope that Internet services will
liberalize their policies toward greater user privacy, freedom and reuse of
what people post, such as promoting Creative Commons, a copyright
licensing system that reserves only some, not all, rights for the author so
that works can be seen and used by the widest possible audience. It’s in
the best interest of the sites’ owners, I believe, to protect privacy and
promote openness. That’s why I believe they’ll move more and more in
those directions.

Community
One of the most important roles you’ll have in the new media
environment is creating and managing community. What you do in a socially
mediated world is at least as much about community as what you produce
on your own. The conversations you foster online will help people
understand what you’re doing, and will help you keep them involved.
Until very recently, newspapers and broadcasters have failed
miserably at creating community. They’ve barely even grasped the basics,
in part because their traditional one-to-many model fostered institutional
arrogance. Luckily, we can learn from people who jumped in early.
Robert Niles, who has created a number of online services
including the award-winning ThemeParkInsider.com, says that
tomorrow’s journalists will need to be community organizers—and that
you’ll need to understand that the people who pay the bills, not just the
audience, comprise one of the communities you’ll need to organize and
serve. This is true for a one-person effort or a larger one.
“Know what you’re doing online,” Niles says. “Embrace
community organizing; create value for a community... [and] you will find
a community that will value you.”
According to Niles, the role of a community organizer doesn’t just
imply taking stands; it almost demands it. At the same time, one should
never lose sight of journalistic principles:
Embrace advocacy, but let it be guided by smart reporting and
thoughtful community engagement. That will be what
distinguishes your site, and your community, from the many
blogs and websites run by people who aren’t as capable as
reporters, or as effective in community organizing.
You’ll find lots of resources online about community creation. We’ll
list a bunch of them online, but in the end you’ll need to recognize that
the key is you: If you don’t take this seriously, you won’t be able to make
it work.
Trolls and Breakage
One essential part of community management is preventing the
kind of damage that bad folks can cause, and fixing it when they
inevitably do. This is about more than keeping your software up to date
with security “patches” and other preventive maintenance. It’s about the
conversation, too.
92 Mediactive
If you’ve participated in online conversations in a more-than-casual
way, you probably know how quickly they can turn wrong. Scary, ugly
wrong.
There’s something about speaking anonymously that inspires
people to misbehave. They’ll say things to each other that they wouldn’t
dream of saying in person, partly because they’re not within physical
reach.
In Chapter 11 I’ll propose a community user-management system
that (as far as I know) doesn’t yet exist. It would discriminate—I use that
word deliberately—among various kinds of members, giving the most
credence to people who use verified real names and are rated highly by
other credible members of the community. Even though we don’t have an
ideal system of this sort, we’re not helpless today in the face of the trolls.
Well-meaning people (including me) have suggested honor codes,
blogger comment guidelines and all sorts of other non-technical ways to
enforces civil behavior. I’m skeptical of anything that we might try to
impose on anyone, but I do believe that we, as community hosts, have
every right—even a duty—to impose rules inside our own sites. Simply
put, I don’t invite people into my home and then tolerate them spitting
on the living room rug (literally or figuratively). You shouldn’t, either.
And you should enforce the rules you set.
When I ran a community site in 2005, I consulted several friends
about rules of the road for folks who wanted to join the community.
They included my friend Lisa Stone and her team at BlogHer.com, who
have created a thoughtful set of guidelines; I recommend you start there
when coming up with your own. My own site’s guidelines borrowed from
BlogHer and several other sites. Here’s an excerpt:
In short, we aim here for civility and mutual respect. Beyond
that, we encourage robust discussions and debate.
Members may be blocked from the site for vandalism, making
personal attacks on other members, publishing others’
copyrighted material or for violating the guidelines and
comments policy.
Offensive, inflammatory or otherwise inappropriate screen
names are not permitted, and the use of these will be
prevented through blocking of accounts. Members blocked
for having an inappropriate name will be permitted to rejoin
under a new name.

We also recognized that the rules weren’t the final word, and
moreover that we couldn’t possibly watch everything. So we added:
Remember, we need your help.
This is a community. If you see material that violates our site
rules and guidelines, please contact us.
Please also make suggestions, on our forums or via e-mail, on
how we might improve these terms and guidelines.
Feel free to borrow and amend—that’s another way the Internet
works at its best.
Comment-moderation systems are becoming more sophisticated,
and the best community sites police themselves to some degree: The
users spot the bad stuff and help the site managers get rid of it. But even
the best-run sites have problems dealing with the truly malevolent
people. The Web still has its trolls and others who wreck things for sport.
This is an arms race that won’t end anytime soon, but if the community
is on your—and its own—side, you can keep up.
It’s More Than Technology
The most important element in your media creation is not the
technology. The tools get cheaper and easier to use all the time. There’s
scarcely any financial barrier to entry.
What matters is you. If you have the skills, or are willing to learn
them, you can stand out from the avalanche of information that pours
over us every day. If you have the energy to pursue your media creation,
you’ll get more done than someone who doesn’t care as much.
Most of all, if you have the integrity to do things right—to follow
the principles that add up to honorable journalism—you can be a creator
who makes a difference, whether it’s in your neighborhood or, perhaps,
on a global scale.
