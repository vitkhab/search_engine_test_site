# Part III: Introduction
We’re going to switch gears a bit here. Until now we’ve been focusing on
our participation in media, as consumers and as creators. The next
several chapters look more widely at topics that are not as much about
what we can do individually as what we need to consider as a society.
Why the broader brush? Because the issues I’m going to discuss are
intertwined with media, participatory media in particular. The success of
mediactivity depends on them.
When we look at things like copyright and other legal issues, as we
will do in the next chapter, we are looking directly at how well any of us
may be able to participate in tomorrow’s media. When we consider the
social customs of the recent past, and agree that we need to update them
in the new century’s flourishing digital age, we are understanding another
key part of our participatory culture.
And when we consider who should be bringing mediactive values
to our children (and ourselves), we’re considering a broader effect than
the impact on our own immediate needs.
Our work won’t be done even when we get all of this. I noted early
in the book that we’re only in the early days of this amazing and, I
believe, wonderful evolution. That means we have a long way to go, and
it’s worth considering what pieces of the puzzle are still obviously
missing. Of course, once we locate them, we’ll realize how much more
there is to do. We’ll be working on this for our lifetimes. So will our
grandchildren, for theirs.
As societies and within our narrower communities of geography
and interest, we’ll get closer and closer to something vital for the
function of self-governing societies: a diverse, robust and trustworthy
mediasphere. Remember, we can’t do it alone.

Chapter 9
Laws and Norms
In the spring of 2008, the popular blog BoingBoing lampooned some
terms of service that a company called MagicJack had imposed on users
of its Internet telephone service, as well as a misleading visitor-counter
on its website. Discussing the terms of service, BoingBoing’s Rob
Beschizza explained (among other things) that users had to agree that the
company could analyze their calling patterns to send them targeted
advertising, and that it could force customers to arbitrate any disputes in
Florida.
MagicJack sued, claiming the posting had caused irreparable harm
to its reputation. BoingBoing, an ad-supported business that’s insured
against defamation claims, was not intimidated and fought back. In 2010,
a California court ruled that MagicJack had no case because what
Beschizza had written was a reasonable portrayal of what MagicJack itself
had published in its terms of service and on its website. The judge also
ordered the company to pay a big portion of BoingBoing’s legal fees.
Several of BoingBoing’s contributors are friends of mine, and I was
overjoyed to hear that they’d successfully fended off a company that was
trying to use the courts to shut down protected free speech. The case
highlighted the importance of a robust marketplace for ideas. But the
bloggers’ victory was also a reminder that some risks accompany the
exercise of our First Amendment rights.
While the BoingBoing case was moving through the courts,
America’s media-critic-in-chief, President Barack Obama, cautioned a
group of 14- and 15-year-olds to be careful about what they posted
online. His advice was prompted, during a Virginia school visit, by a
query from a student who’d announced his intention to become
president some day. According to the White House’s transcript, the
current president offered, in the first of what he called “practical tips” for
ambitious young people, this suggestion:
I want everybody here to be careful about what you post on
Facebook—because in the YouTube age, whatever you do, it
will be pulled up again later somewhere in your life. And when 
126 Mediactive
you’re young, you make mistakes and you do some stupid
stuff. And I’ve been hearing a lot about young people who,
you know, they’re posting stuff on Facebook, and then
suddenly they go apply for a job and somebody has done a
search and, so that’s some practical political advice for you
right there.
Obama’s advice was conventional wisdom, and was undoubtedly
correct in today’s world. I hope he’s wrong in tomorrow’s.
The BoingBoing case and Obama’s cautions, which I’ll discuss in
more detail later, combine all sorts of issues that we need to consider in a
democratized media world: law, social customs and more. How we
behave online has ramifications.
Let me reassure you: If you’ve taken to heart the principles I’ve
outlined in earlier chapters, you can much more easily minimize whatever
risks there may be in your own participation online. How? Be honorable.
It’s that simple.
That said, we can’t reduce risk to zero, partly because the legal
system invites abuses from people whose goal is to shut down speech
they don’t like. Meanwhile, the system is evolving to adapt to new
challenges.
Laws increasingly determine how we can use online resources as
active consumers. This starts with whether we can find the resources at
all. Many governments take great pains to block what they see as
dangerous (usually for them) or immoral material. According to the
OpenNet Initiative, a project that documents Internet filtering and
surveillance, a number of countries actively censor what their residents
can readily see. Along with controlling what we get to see, both
governments and private entities track our every move via digital
surveillance.*
Some laws and regulations, especially in the copyright arena, give
enormous power to large enterprises that make decisions about our
Internet use. Others apply to everything from our comments on other
people’s sites to the material we publish on our own, as the BoingBoing
example and others in this chapter will show.

*You might imagine this to be merely a Chinese problem, or an issue in Saudi Arabia
and other places under authoritarian rule. Sadly, the U.S. government is making similar
noises. As I write this, Congress is considering a bill, aimed at stopping copyright
infringement, that would invite—and in some cases force—Internet service providers to
block access to sites deemed to host troublesome material, even if those sites also host
totally unobjectionable content.
Dan Gillmor 127
Again, I don’t want to scare you here. The odds that you will get in
unjust legal trouble are slim. But as you’ll see in the pages ahead,
forewarned is forearmed; it’s better to know about something ahead of
time so you can prepare, however remote the possibility may be that
you’ll be affected.
Laws are only part of the issue, as Obama’s cautions demonstrated.
We also need to adjust some attitudes and learn some new skills—
individually and as a society—in order to keep up with the collaborative
communications tools that not only empower us in such amazing ways,
but also can cause difficulties if we’re not fully aware of what we’re
doing.
These attitudes and skills are about what sociologists call norms—
principles of behavior that, according to Webster’s definition, “guide,
control, or regulate proper and acceptable behavior.” When I use the word
here, I’m talking about societal acceptance, about generally agreed ways to
behave. In Japan, for example, it’s a norm to take off your shoes when you
enter someone’s home, and bow when greeting someone; in America we
tend to keep our shoes on and shake hands. I’m emphatically not talking
about laws and regulations, which are enforced by governments; norms are
enforced, if that’s the right word, but by you and me.
The principles outlined in Chapters 2 and 5, which undergird this
entire project, are fundamentally about norms, as is Obama’s advice and
some of the other material presented later in this chapter. There can be
negative consequences for acting outside the norms, but you’re generally
free to do so as long as you don’t mind the consequences.
Law and Order
Let’s look at a few of the key legal issues first. These include the
way laws affect our basic rights as users of media as well as our legal
responsibilities in such areas as defamation, copyright and privacy.
Keep in mind that this survey is, once again, a high-altitude look
down at the landscape, not a detailed map or a legal guide. I’m not a
lawyer, and nothing here is intended to be legal advice.
Privacy and Surveillance
The same tools that give us such incredible freedom to create and
share are also a cause for caution. As the Electronic Frontier
Foundationsays, “New technologies are radically advancing our
freedoms, but they are also enabling unparalleled invasions of privacy.”
128 Mediactive
It’s possible to invite some of the invasions, of course, even in
routine use of the Web. If you sign up for mobile phone social
networks that broadcast your location to friends and others who use
the same services, you’re giving up some privacy. If you post on
Facebook, you’re being public. As we’ll discuss later in this chapter,
we all need to think about how other people—including people we
don’t imagine to be following us—could make use of the information
we radiate.
Beyond the information we release willingly is a cornucopia of
information released about us by others. A GPS-enabled mobile phone
tells the mobile network company and anyone with access to the carrier’s
data where you are and where you’ve been. And when you shop online,
or even just browse, you are providing data that’s the rough equivalent of
having someone follow you around a shopping mall with a video camera,
recording and storing everything you buy or even look at.
Americans know (because journalists have ferreted out the story)
that their government created a vast and illegal surveillance system that
was used to monitor American communications for years during the
Bush administration. For all we know, that monitoring is still happening;
the Obama government claims essentially all of the same rights as its
predecessor to do what it pleases, never mind the Constitution.
That’s bad enough, but the companies that provide digital
technology and network services have unparalleled abilities to watch your
every move as well. And many cyber-criminals floating around those
networks (working remotely from places like Russia, in many cases) have
the technical sophistication to play malevolent games with your
communications, including financial ones.
There are laws supposedly protecting privacy, or at least misuse of
data. The problem is that they’re rarely enforced, and the penalties for
violating them are not much of a deterrent.
Just as you need to put much sturdier locks on your door in a bad
neighborhood, you need to take steps to preserve (what’s left of) your
privacy online. One of the most important measures is actually the
simplest: Keep your software up to date, applying the bug fixes and
security “patches” companies provide. Another is to use Web browser
plug-ins such as the NoScript add-on for the Mozilla Firefox browser,
which lets you block many of the kinds of drive-by attacks you can
encounter in your routine Web browsing.
As you increase your mediactivity from the routine, it’s honorable
to give users of your blog or website as much privacy as possible,
including protecting their data from being extracted and used by a 
Dan Gillmor 129
hacker. Just as you need to keep the software you run on your own
computer current, you should be as certain as you can be that your Webhosting
provider is doing the same on its own systems.
Sidebar: Privacy and Facebook—Why I Quit and
Rejoined
I use Facebook for several reasons. One is my professional interest
in keeping track of what’s happening in the planet’s largest social
network, including what application developers and users are doing there.
More personal is that some of my friends—actual friends—use the site,
and Facebook helps me stay in touch with them.
But when Facebook made a dramatic change to its privacy structure
at the end of 2009, I concluded I could no longer trust the service, even
with the limited amount of things I’ve said and done there since I got an
account several years ago. I continue to admire the company’s
accomplishments in many other ways, so why did I no longer feel safe
and sound in the hands of Facebook?
Even though some of the changes made in the privacy settings were
actually helpful—notably, the ability to set privacy options for individual
posts—the overall bias was troubling. As an analysis by the Electronic
Frontier Foundation concluded, the new settings “push Facebook users
to publicly share even more information than before. Even worse, the
changes will actually reduce the amount of control that users have over
some of their personal data.”
Facebook’s extremely smart leaders know perfectly well that the
majority of users are likely to accept these suggestions. Most people say
yes to whatever the default settings are in any application, even though
we should always be wary of the defaults, precisely for reasons like this.
I wasn’t very happy with my Facebook situation in any case. Early
on, I said yes to just about everyone who asked me to “friend” them,
including people barely knew and some I didn’t know at all.
The privacy changes—and my continuing uncertainty about what I
was sharing, given the still-large number of pages you have to look at to
modify your settings—made me realize I’d rather take fewer chances. So
I made a fairly drastic change.
I deleted my account. Then I started a new one.
Actually, I scheduled the old one for deletion, which is all Facebook
allowed. The company figures, perhaps correctly, that some people will
have made this decision rashly and wants to give them a chance to 
130 Mediactive
reconsider. And it’s clearly in Facebook’s business interest to minimize
the number of cancellations.
It wasn’t easy to figure out how to delete the account, which no
doubt is part of the company’s strategy, too. If you go to the Settings
page, the only option offered is to “deactivate,” not delete.
But a little searching on the site turns up a Facebook Group called
“How to permanently delete your Facebook account” (with more than
70,000 members at the time of this writing)—which in turn reveals an
actual delete-account form located at still another Web address that
Facebook doesn’t reveal in any prominent way, if at all.
After creating my new account, I checked the default privacy
settings. They’re pretty un-private, in my view, sharing way too much
with people you don’t know. I systematically went through the various
screens—Facebook makes this chore both annoying and obscure—to
ratchet down the settings to something I can live with.
We all know Facebook profits from exposing to search engines and
advertisers the largest possible number of pages by the largest number of
people willing to create stuff and make it public. Marketers drool at the
prospects Facebook offers, and Facebook’s entirely rational goal is to
make profits in almost any way it can. What’s in the corporate interest,
however, doesn’t necessarily match what’s in my interest, or yours.
So I’m still at facebook.com/dangillmor—though my real Web
home base is dangillmor.com, as we’ll discuss in the next chapter—but
now I have just a small selection of Facebook friends. I’ll be adding
more, but not in any hasty way.
Freedom to Tinker: Who Owns Your iPhone,
Anyway?
You may think you own the device you bought last week from a
retailer. But it is increasingly the case that what you own is only the
hardware; you don’t own the right to use it the way you want to use it,
even for entirely legal purposes.
The consequences of this reality have been researched deeply by
Jonathan Zittrain, a Harvard law professor, friend and colleague from
when I was a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society. He is
also the author of The Future of the Internet—and How to Stop It. Zittrain
describes a potential future in which the very qualities that have made the
Internet so valuable—notably, its openness to innovation by
everybody—are in danger. Whereas the personal computer and the early
Internet were a wide-open collection of technologies on which anyone 
Dan Gillmor 131
could build software and services, now governments and the technology
and media industries increasingly want to clamp down on your freedoms.
Zittrain writes:
A lockdown on PCs and a corresponding rise of tethered
appliances [like the iPhone] will eliminate what today we take
for granted: a world where mainstream technology can be
influenced, even revolutionized, out of left field. Stopping this
future depends on some wisely developed and implemented
locks, along with new technologies and a community ethos
that secures the keys to those locks among groups with shared
norms and a sense of public purpose, rather than in the hands
of a single gatekeeping entity, whether public or private.
The iPhone and iPad are the best examples yet of a controlled
ecosystem, and not just because you have to tether them to a PC or Mac
in order to fully manage the music, songs, apps and other files on these
(admittedly lovely) devices. With the Macintosh computer, Apple built an
essentially open ecosystem for software developers. Anyone could write
and sell (or give away) software for the Mac, and still can, just as they can
for Windows and Linux and other computer operating systems. But with
the iPhone and the iPad, Apple expanded on its experience with the
iTunes Music Store, creating a system for retailing applications designed
for these devices—but only if Apple has approved them. The number of
applications available is said to exceed 300,000, but there are welldocumented
horror stories featuring Apple’s refusal, often on mysterious
grounds, to allow specific applications to be sold or even given away to
iPhone/iPad users.
You can still create what you want on the Web, and iPhone users
can still find it via the device’s Safari browser—but sorry, no videos using
Adobe’s Flash player that runs most videos on desktop and laptop
computers. Meanwhile, if you want your audience to experience your
work in any way that uses the iPhone or iPad hardware to its fullest
capabilities, you need Apple’s permission to distribute the app that does
this. And, then, if you get permission and charge for your application, or
for any services you provide via your application, Apple insists on taking
a cut of the money.
Google’s Android mobile operating system is more open, but the
company’s real customers for it are the mobile carriers—AT&T, Verizon,
etc.—that are busy locking down what their customers can do with their
devices. Control-freakery is endemic, and dangerous.
132 Mediactive
Amazon, a company in which I own some stock, has locked down
its Kindle platform, too. The Kindle is the most popular e-reader by far,
and while I own one I’m extremely unhappy about Amazon’s hard-nosed
insistence that it can control your Kindle. The company was
appropriately embarrassed (and had to pay out a court settlement) for
remotely deleting several books by George Orwell, including 1984—oh,
the irony—from the Kindles of people who’d bought the editions from
what turned out to be a publisher that was unauthorized to sell them.
While Amazon apologized for its actions, it didn’t say what would
happen if some judge or government agency ordered it to remove books
or other content from the devices in the future.
This is not just about your right to read and use media as you wish.
It is also about the way you will be able to make available what you create
in the future. If you believe in freedom of speech, and see mediactivity’s
value to our lives, our culture and our democracy, you should be deeply
alarmed by the trends we’re seeing.
Open Networks
Apple’s attitude is alarming enough, but the company is a freedom
fighter compared with the major telecommunications companies. Brazen
control freaks, they don’t have enough competitors—as Apple still
does—to give them the slightest concern for the independent desires of
their customers.
In We the Media I wrote that we are heading into a world with only
one, two or at most three broadband telecommunications providers
serving any given geographical community. I asked, back in 2004:
Should giant telecommunications companies—namely cable and
local phone providers—have vertical control over everything
from the data transport to the content itself? For example, as I
was writing this book, Comcast, the cable monopoly in my area,
was trying to buy Disney. The attempt failed. If this happened,
Comcast could have decided to deliver Disney’s content online
more quickly than someone else’s, discriminating on the basis of
financial considerations. Such a regime would have been a
disaster for the unimpeded flow of information. We should insist
on a more horizontal system, in which the owner of the pipe is
obliged to provide interconnections to competing services.
Unfortunately, today’s regulatory and political power brokers lean
in the wrong direction.
Dan Gillmor 133
Late in 2009, Comcast announced it was buying NBC Universal,
one of the biggest “content” companies on the planet. It’s time to worry,
and to act.
What’s at stake? Free-speech activists have worried for years about
the corporate consolidation of mass media. In the era when mass media
held nearly total sway, that was a reasonable fear. And to the extent that
Big Media holds onto its huge audiences, it’s still a legitimate issue.
But now we face a consolidation that dwarfs anything contemplated
before: the “broadband” oligopoly’s increasing control over what we can
do with our media. The cable and phone giants are determined to decide
what bits get delivered in what order, at what speed and at what time—if
at all—to the people who want them. We are heading toward a level of
media control that, if the telecom companies succeed in achieving it, will
threaten every bit of the work I and many others have been doing for the
past decade—not to mention our mediactive future.
What do these companies want? Their plain goal is to turn the
Internet into something that resembles cable television, where they
decide which channels you need and which you’ll pay extra to get (in this
case, penalizing you if you want your own choice of feeds, videos and the
like at the same speed you get their preferred ones).
What’s especially galling is the telecom companies’ claims that they
have a right to control your choices because the networks are entirely
their own property. Historically, they got this property via monopoly
deals with local governments, allowing them to tear up streets and claim
rights of way in a system that no new competitor can possibly duplicate.
Serious competition, except in a tiny number of places, is unlikely,
barring some advances in mobile technology that are more theoretical
than imminent.
The mobile carriers are, if anything, even more restrictive. They
have a reason at the moment, given the limited capacity of their
networks. But in moves that can’t remotely be blamed on network
availability, they have curtailed all kinds of activities that they deem
contrary to their own interests: notably, preventing Internet-based voice
applications from competing. Alarmingly, Google—once a prime mover
for “network neutrality,” the term open-network advocates use to
describe the kinds of networks we need—has joined with Verizon in a
public statement all but abandoning the principle for mobile networks.
The Federal Communications Commission has been looking at
network neutrality, but in the end Congress will decide this, and Congress
has been a pawn of the telecom industry for too long. You should care
about your ability to read and watch what you want, and the ability of 
134 Mediactive
others to read or watch what you create, in a fair marketplace. And if you
do care, you should tell the people who represent you in the U.S. House
and Senate that you do, and why.
Copyrights and Takedowns
One reason network providers are clamping down is pressure from
the copyright cartel composed of the Hollywood movie studios and the
big music recording companies. They call copyright infringement by a
different name—“piracy”—and they’ve relentlessly protected their mass
media content from anyone who might use it in any unauthorized way.
You have rights, as a consumer and a mediactive creator, as part of
the broader “fair use” doctrine. For example, you can make personal
backup copies of the music you buy. You also have the right to use other
people’s work in limited ways to create new works. (The key word there
is “limited”—don’t cut and paste large parts of other people’s work,
period; and always, always credit the creator whose material you do quote
or reuse.)
The cartel says it has nothing against fair use, but the policies it
advocates would effectively do away with that right and many others. Its
members want to tell you when you can copy anything for any reason.
This is an attack on journalism, among other things (including
scholarship).
The more we need permission to use other peoples’ work, the less
building we’ll all do on what’s come before. Yet quoting is at the heart of
cultural and scientific progress.
This doesn’t mean we should do away with copyright. I’m a big
believer in its proper uses, which include balancing the incentive to create
with the public’s right to use what others have created in new ways.
One of the heartening developments in recent years has been the
growth of Creative Commons, an organization that helps people create
and use material under a system that shares the creators’ rights with the
general public in ways that promote further creative development. This
book, like my last one, is published under a Creative Commons license
permitting you to freely copy it for non-commercial purposes, and to build
on what you find in new works provided that you give full attribution and
release any new works based on this one under the same terms.
Copyright holders have a powerful weapon online: the “takedown
notice” they can send to a site where, they allege, someone has posted
works in an infringing way. If the site owners put up the material
themselves, they are legally liable (although usually the copyright holder 
Dan Gillmor 135
asks for no punishment beyond having the content removed). If a site user
posted the material, the site host can avoid legal trouble by complying with
the takedown notice. If whoever posted it challenges the notice, saying the
material is not infringing, the content goes back up, and the copyright
holder is then required to litigate if he or she wants to force the issue.
It sounds like a good system, but in practice, copyright holders have
abused it. If the person being threatened with a lawsuit has the means to
fight back, though, the plaintiffs can be held financially liable for
“abusive” claims—as Diebold, a company that sold electronic voting
machines, did when it “knowingly misrepresented that online
commentators, including IndyMedia and two Swarthmore college
students, had infringed the company’s copyrights.” In that case, Diebold
was sued successfully by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and had to
pay $125,000 in damages and fees.
Some Legal Resources
The Citizen Media Law Project (CMLP) is based at Harvard
University’s Law School and the Berkman Center for Internet & Society.
I’m biased toward this project, because I co-founded it and blog
occasionally on the CMLP website. The project features resources
ranging from a database of legal threats to, most recently, the Online
Media Legal Network, which “connects lawyers from across the country
with online journalists and digital media creators who need legal help.”
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit based in San
Francisco, works to preserve our liberties in the technology and cyberspace
spheres. I also have some bias here: In 2002 the EFF honored me with one
of its annual Pioneer awards, and I’m friendly with the organization’s
founders, John Perry Barlow, John Gilmore and Mitch Kapor. (I’ve also
been a financial donor to the EFF, and I urge you to do the same.)
There’s an enormous amount of useful material at the CMLP and
EFF websites. I’d strongly suggest that you look around, especially if you
have any questions about what you might encounter as a creator—or
host—of online content. They aren’t the only excellent resources, and
we’ll list many other sources on the Mediactive website as well.
Defamation and Other Risks
What is defamation? According to the EFF:
Generally, defamation is a false and unprivileged statement of
fact that is harmful to someone’s reputation, and published 
136 Mediactive
“with fault,” meaning as a result of negligence or malice. State
laws often define defamation in specific ways. Libel is a
written defamation; slander is a spoken defamation.
You are not exempt from laws just because you say things online. If
you libel people on your blog or in a comment on someone else’s blog,
they can sue you and win.
If you follow the principles in Chapter 4, you’re unlikely to libel
anyone. Does that mean you’ll be immune from being sued?
Unfortunately, no.
Anyone can sue anyone else for the cost of filing a court fee, and
judges rarely punish people for filing lawsuits they can’t win (even if they
probably know they can’t). Moreover, whereas in some countries, such as
the United Kingdom, libel defendants have to prove that what they’ve
said was true, in the U.S. the plaintiff has to show that it was false (and
public figures additionally have to prove that the statements were made
maliciously or with indifference to the truth).
Since defamation and libel do happen for real, and can hurt people,
you should be careful about what you say online, just as you would if you
were giving a speech. From the principles laid out in Chapter 5, it should
be obvious that you need to be accurate when you say something
negative about somebody. I don’t say this to scare you away from
holding up the light to wrongdoing. Getting incontrovertible evidence of
your claims and being fair to the people you criticize will be your best
insurance against a libel lawsuit—but no amount of care is foolproof.
Defending yourself, even if you’re absolutely in the right, is
expensive. So learn ahead of time ways to avoid legal risk, even if you
can’t prevent it entirely. The EFF has an excellent Legal Guide for
Bloggers. Here are several other valuable resources:
 The Knight Citizen News Network’s “Top 10 Rules for
Limiting Your Legal Risk”: A set of concepts and solid advice
for minimizing the risk you expose yourself to.
 The Citizen Media Law Project’s Legal Guide: This increasingly
comprehensive guide has an enormous amount of content
dealing with individual states. One of the best features is a
“decision tree” that helps you decide whether you need separate
insurance for defamation and other legal risks beyond what you
may already have in your homeowner’s or renter’s policy.
 Online Media Law: The Basics for Bloggers and Other Online
Publishers. This is a multimedia course offered via the Poynter 
Dan Gillmor 137
Institute’s News University. Once you pass it you may be
eligible to buy specially priced insurance.
According to Kimberley Isbell, an attorney with the Harvard
project and a Berkman Center Fellow, what kinds of issues you cover and
how you do it determines the level of risk: Applying basic journalistic
standards, such as accuracy and fairness, reduces the risk. Isbell also
stresses the importance of being careful in how you use other people’s
work, to avoid copyright troubles.
Not all the news is scary in this arena. If you or your organization
host an online conversation, you benefit from one of the most positive
parts of Congress’s 1996 telecommunications overhaul: an exemption
from defamation and similar claims. This exception does not extend to
the person doing the defamation. This protection for site owners has
done incalculable good for freedom of speech.
Photographers, Stand Your Ground
One of the most pernicious escalations against media creators in
recent years has been the war on photography in public places. Again and
again, we hear how overzealous law-enforcement people—and private
security guards—have challenged people who are doing nothing more
than taking pictures in public places. They claim to be preventing
terrorism, but the evidence for this is at best thin.
A number of websites have sprung up to catalog and protest
infringements on our rights to take pictures and videos. One of the best
is called, unsurprisingly, “War on Photography,” and it’s full of
depressingly familiar tales of harassment by officious transit workers,
police officers, and security guards, among others.
The U.S. has nothing, in this regard, on the police-state tactics that
become more obnoxious every year in the nation that gave us the Magna
Carta: the United Kingdom. The horror stories there are enough to make
you leave your camera home on a tourism visit, or, perhaps more wisely,
visit a less paranoid nation.
Security expert Bruce Schneier is among the many who point out
the futility, not to mention almost pure inanity, of this kind of official
behavior. He urges us all to stand up for our rights:
Fear aside, there aren’t many legal restrictions on what you can
photograph from a public place that’s already in public view.
If you’re harassed, it’s almost certainly a law enforcement
official, public or private, acting way beyond his authority. 
138 Mediactive
There’s nothing in any post-9/11 law that restricts your right
to photograph.
This is worth fighting. Search “photographer rights” on
Google and download one of the several wallet documents
that can help you if you get harassed; I found one for the UK,
US, and Australia. Don’t cede your right to photograph in
public. Don’t propagate the terrorist photographer story.
Remind them that prohibiting photography was something we
used to ridicule about the USSR. Eventually sanity will be
restored, but it may take a while.
Freedom of Information: Public Records
One of the most important initiatives in recent decades has been
the opening up of government records to public inspection. Although
the U.S. federal government went into reverse on open records during
the Bush administration, the trend at the federal and state level, and
increasingly around the globe, is toward more openness and access.
When you request government records, keep this in mind:
1. You don’t need to give a reason for your request. It’s your
business, not theirs, why you want to see public documents.
2. You should be as specific as possible about what you want.
Overly broad document or data requests don’t help you or
your search.
3. Be persistent. Officials may turn you down the first time (and
in my experience as a journalist, they often did), just to see if
you’re serious.
You can find a wealth of online resources on open records laws, state
and federal. One is the National Freedom of Information Coalition, which
sees its role as protecting the people’s right to oversee their government.
In early 2010, the coalition won a $2 million grant to launch a
freedom of information fund to help litigate state and local denials of
open-records requests by citizens. This underscored the difficult side of
open-records laws: dealing with recalcitrant officials who don’t care what
the law says. (I’m on the board of the First Amendment Coalition, a
California-based nonprofit that litigates such requests.)
Public documents these days include data from databases, not just
paper documents. In Chapter 10 I’ll discuss some ways we can use that
data to help create what is being called “Government 2.0.”

Shield Laws
Apple isn’t just control-freakish with its hardware. It’s one of the
most secretive companies in the world. In 2004, claiming trade secrets
had been violated, Apple Inc. sued several internal “John Does”—
employees who’d leaked product information to several websites—and
demanded that the sites turn over details on where they had gotten the
information. At the request of lawyers working for those sites (I was not
paid), I declared in legal documents that in my expert opinion the sites
were doing a form of journalism protected under California law. Several
courts agreed, and the online journalists were not required to turn over
the information.
California is one of many states with shield laws for journalists and
confidential sources. Importantly, in the Apple case, the courts
understood that even if the websites weren’t doing traditional journalism,
it was journalism nonetheless.
As of this writing, we still don’t have a federal shield law, though
one is making its way through Congress. But when and if it does pass, I
hope it will protect journalism, in whatever form that takes—not the
people we call journalists.
Having said all this about shield laws, I want to stress again that
anonymous sources make me queasy. You may someday need to shield
someone from harmful exposure, but you will be exposing yourself to
challenges from common-sense readers who ask why your source didn’t
have the courage to speak on the record.
Overreach by Prosecutors
If you are honorable, you’re almost certainly free from the risk of
what follows. But when the laws get twisted to take down someone
everyone dislikes, that’s when we should all pay attention to our own
freedoms.
In particular, when public officials start talking about “protecting
the children,” you may be hearing the standard code words for whacking
civil liberties—and in the Internet age, core liberties such as free speech
are in jeopardy.
The ugly case of Lori Drew is one example. Drew’s daughter was
involved in a conflict with Megan Meier, a teenage neighbor. Drew and
several other people created a bogus MySpace account for a fictitious
teenaged boy who wooed and then rejected Meier. Soon after, Meier
committed suicide at her suburban St. Louis home. One thing is 
140 Mediactive
absolutely clear in this sordid case: Drew and her helpers in this sleazy
scheme were heartless, and have been justly pilloried for their acts. But
was this a prosecutable offence?
Officials in Missouri had no cause for criminal action because no
state law fit the case. But federal prosecutors hauled Drew off to Los
Angeles, headquarters of MySpace, and tried her for violating a federal
law, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which had been used
in the past to go after hackers who’d plundered others’ computers for
financial gain. Using a computer, prosecutors said, Drew had:
[I]ntentionally accessed and caused to be accessed a computer
used in interstate commerce, namely, the MySpace servers
located in Los Angeles County, California, within the Central
District of California, without authorization and in excess of
authorized access, and, by means of interstate commerce
obtained and caused to be obtained information from that
computer to further tortious acts, namely intentional infliction
of emotional distress on [Meier].
As the Citizen Media Law Project’s Matt Sanchez explained,
Drew’s alleged crime was, boiled down to the actual law as opposed to
the emotional element of the case, “nothing other than failing to submit
‘truthful and accurate’ registration information when creating a
MySpace profile. She would have been no less liable for misstating her
height.”
Think about this. When using online registration systems, have you
always, without exception, given utterly accurate information?
A jury acquitted Drew on a felony charge but found her guilty on a
less-serious misdemeanor violation of the CFAA. But the judge
overturned even that; as he explained in his ruling, allowing Drew’s
verdict to stand would have made everyone who’s ever violated a terms
of service agreement, no matter how minor the violation, guilty of a
crime as well.
The prosecutor, Thomas P. O’Brien, didn’t care. As Wired News
reported, he was proud of himself. Sure, he said, using the CFAA was “a
risk,” but his office “will always take risks on behalf of children.”
The larger risk was, in fact, to liberty. O’Brien’s willingness to twist
a law to serve even a well-meaning end deserves contempt, not praise,
because he’s supposed to know better. We are fortunate that the judge
rescued the rest of us—not just the despicable Drew—from a prosecutor
whose legal theories would have made criminals of just about everyone
who has ever signed up for just about anything online.
Dan Gillmor 141
Can the law handle a case like Drew’s? Or what about the
September 2010 suicide of a Rutgers University student who jumped off
the George Washington Bridge after a video of him and a male friend
having sex was posted online? Two fellow students were charged with
invasion of privacy.
Harvard law professor John Palfrey—a friend and former colleague
of mine when I was a Fellow at the Berkman Center, where he was
executive director—advises caution. He wrote in the New York Times of
the Rutgers case and a Massachusetts suicide also attributed to cyberbullying:
In using the law to address this problem, we need first to
examine whether the law is sufficient in this new hybrid
online-offline environment to discourage this kind of behavior
and whether we are acting in a just manner with respect to
those who are harmed and those who do the harm. Second,
we need to ask whether our law enforcement officials have the
support they need to get the job done.
Most states have a series of laws that address criminal harassment,
whether it happens online or offline. These laws ordinarily permit both
criminal enforcement by the state and civil lawsuits. One challenge
associated with these laws is to not criminalize behavior that amounts to
ordinary teenager-to-teenager nastiness while drawing a line well before
the kinds of behavior that might lead to a teenager’s suicide.
Again, anyone who is honorable isn’t going to do this kind of thing.
Still, we need to be aware of so-called fixes to essentially moral
problems—fixes that could make it harder for everyone to participate in
our new collaborative environment.
Norms and Customs
Indeed, the cases I’ve described weren’t, in the end, only about law.
They also had everything to do with the norms, or customs, we should
consider as we work, play and collaborate in a digital mediasphere.
In previous chapters we’ve considered how we should react to
things we find online, especially derogatory and even hateful speech, and
how we should behave ourselves in our speech. I want to give these
issues extra emphasis here.
It should go without saying that people shouldn’t use our new
media tools for cruel purposes. Given that some will, what kinds of 
142 Mediactive
norms can we encourage so that the targets of cruelty can either respond
or, better yet, learn to ignore the attacks?
Telling our children to grow thicker skins is, of course, not going to
get us very far, and we don’t want to create a generation of purely cynical
adults. But social-media training needs to include the digital-age versions
of cautions we’ve long suggested to children, such as the admonition not
to get into a car with an adult who’s a stranger. Again, trust depends in
large part on what we can verify, or what we’ve learned, though our own
experience and the advice of others, to trust.
Words Come Back
My friend and Arizona State University colleague Tim McGuire
says, “The fact is one stupid mistake when you are 19 today can kill your
future.”
That’s true—today, anyway, as we learn that what we do online can
often be rediscovered years later.
So when President Obama advised the Virginia student with
political aspirations to watch what he posted on Facebook, he was being
sensible, given the current climate.But if the president’s advice turns out
to have long-term validity, we are in some trouble as a society.
Young people make mistakes and do stupid things. (So do older
people, of course. Meanwhile, my generation’s youthful stupidities are
mostly lost in the mists of time, unpreserved on a hard disk somewhere
in the digital cloud.) But I hope it doesn’t follow, as the president
suggested, that posting “weird” things on the Web in blogs, social
networks and the like should be an automatic turnoff or disqualification
for a responsible job later in life. The notion of punishing someone
decades later for what he or she said or did as a teenager or college
student isn’t just wrong. It’s dangerous.
We’re going to have to cut each other some slack. There’s no
alternative.
A journalism student of mine once asked if it was advisable to
have a personal blog and, if so, to be outspoken on it. He’d apparently
been warned that it could put a crimp in his future journalism career
plans.
I can’t say how others would react. I do know that if I were hiring
someone today I’d want to know what (not if) he or she posted online,
not to find disqualifying factors but to see if that person had interesting
things to say. I’d take for granted that I might find some things that were
risqué or inappropriate for my current world. I’d expect to find things 
Dan Gillmor 143
that would be “unjournalistic” in some ways, such as outspoken or
foolish (or both) views on important people and issues. But I’d also
remember my own ability, if not tendency, to be an idiot when I was that
age. And I’d discount appropriately.
This is all about giving people what my friend Esther Dyson, a
technology investor and seer, has called a “statute of limitations on
stupidity.” If our norms don’t bend so that we can all start cutting each
other more slack in this increasingly transparent society, we’ll only
promote drones—the least imaginative, dullest people—into positions of
authority. Now that’s really scary.
We’re making progress—probably more than Obama gives us
credit for. Recall that it was impossible for a Catholic to be president
until John F. Kennedy was elected. It was impossible for a divorced
person to be elected until Ronald Reagan won. It was impossible for a
former pot smoker to be president until Bill Clinton (who bizarrely
claimed not to have inhaled) got elected. George W. Bush acknowledged
having been a dissolute drunk until he was 40. And so on.
Making These Judgments Is Neither Clear nor Simple
Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell took hits during his 2009
campaign for the office when a 20-year-old master’s thesis came to light.
In that document he denounced programs that encouraged women to
work outside the home and said working women were bad for families.
He wanted voters to ignore all this and concentrate on what he said were
his current positions.
McDonnell deserved some slack, too, but he wrote the thesis when
he was in his mid-30s, not his early 20s or adolescence. His record as a
legislator since then has been extremely conservative, as well. What he
said two decades ago is obviously more relevant, given the circumstances,
than what a student posts on a high-school Facebook page today. Still, he
won the election.
Sometime in the foreseeable future, we’ll elect a president who had
a blog or Facebook wall or MySpace page when she was a teenager or a
college student. By the standards of today, such a person would be utterly
disqualified for any serious political job. But if we adapt as I believe we’ll
have to, we’ll have grown as a society; we’ll have become not just more
tolerant of flaws, but more understanding that we all have feet of clay in
some respect. We’ll elect her anyway, because we’ll realize that the person
she has become—and how that happened—is what counts.
144 Mediactive
How will her peers know all this? They’ll have figured it out for
themselves, but they’ll have had some help, too. They’ll have been taught,
from an early age.
In the next chapter, we’ll see who the teachers should be.
