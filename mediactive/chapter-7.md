# Chapter 7
Owning Your Online Presence
Who are you, anyway? In the digital world, just as in the physical one,
you are partly who others say you are.
This is why you need to be at least one—and preferably the most
prominent—of the voices talking about you. You can’t allow others to
define who you are, or control the way you are perceived. This is
especially true today for people in the public eye, but the more we do
online the more it’ll be true for the rest of us, too.
We’re moving into new territory here. We’ve previously discussed
the value of joining online conversations. Now I want to recognize that
those conversations may, in some respects, be about you and your ideas.
You need to know what people may be saying about you or your work.
And you need to respond when necessary, especially when you need to
clarify or correct what someone has said.
Being public in this increasingly public world means participating. It
means recognizing that what you do online influences the way others see
you. This goes under many names: reputation, brand, influence and the
like. For our purposes I’ll call it “brand,” but I’m not using the word in a
commercial or marketing sense; rather, it’s about how you appear to the
world beyond your family and closest friends, and what you can do to be
seen as you truly are.
In this chapter, we’ll discuss why, and how, you should consider
becoming what amounts to a publisher in your own right. I can almost
see your eyebrows rising as you read this, but don’t worry. Remember,
this is the Digital Age. You don’t have to buy printing presses, or put
up big broadcast towers, or employ anyone. Publishing today is what
we all do. The word carries historical freight, but it’s now an everyday
act.
What I’m getting at, however, is a crucial point: To the extent that
it’s possible to do so, you should control the reference point for people
who want to know more about you and your ideas. We’ll look at how you
can create, own and operate that online touchpoint—call it a home base,
above and beyond the blogging or tweeting you might do elsewhere—for 
96 Mediactive
who you are, and what you do. As always, look for much more detail
about specific tools and techniques at the Mediactive website.
Again, the basics:
1. Whether you create your own media or not, you need to join the
conversation when people are talking about you or your work.
2. Creating media and joining conversations will get you only part
of the way. You also need to create your own online home base,
one that you truly control.
Your Place
If you go to dangillmor.com, you’ll find more about me, and by me,
than you’re likely to care about. The point is, it’s all there. I’ve made that
site my personal home base on the Web. You should consider doing
something like it.
Why would you want to do this? Because you need to present
yourself online on at least one page or site that you control, where others
can check you out—I call it a home base here but on my own page I call
it my “anchor site.” The more we participate in online social life, and the
more our offline doings are fodder for what others see, capture and say
about us, the more we need to give people a way to read our own take on
things, unfiltered.
Please note: I’m absolutely not suggesting that you avoid social
networks like Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Foursquare and any number
of other services designed for communication and collaboration. I do
advise caution when you use them, but they are now so ingrained into
our digital culture that it would be crazy to stay away entirely; besides,
you can learn a lot through participation.
I have accounts at all of those and many other sites. I use several of
them regularly, notably Twitter, but I make sure that what I say publicly
on other sites is reflected on my own home base. This is usually possible,
as I’ll explain below, because Twitter and many other services give you a
fairly easy way to push what you create using them out to other places.
There two basic ways to create your home base. The easy approach
is to make a page, or collection of pages, using a free service. There are
any number of sites that provide such services, including Google Sites
and Tumblr. You might consider Blogger or WordPress.com, both of
which offer profile pages among other parts of their free blogging
services, enough for your needs.
Dan Gillmor 97
Keep in mind, though, that such sites don’t provide these services
just to be helpful. Just as with Flickr and YouTube, you’re putting your
information into their databases, not yours. And you’re using their names
to help promote yours.
The more complex approach, which gives you greater flexibility,
safety (in some ways) and authority, is to be your own publisher. I
recommend it.
Whichever way you go, what you put on your personal site is the
most important thing. Let’s look at that first.
I’m a Brand?
Who we are, at least in a public sense, is the sum of what we do,
what we say and what others say about us. You can’t control what others
say. However, you can absolutely control what you do and say.
Your presence can take many forms in a social-media world. It can
be a Facebook page. It can be Flickr photos or YouTube video uploads.
Or Twitter tweets. Or your own blog. Or several of these, and perhaps
some of the many other options.
As we’ll discuss in an upcoming chapter, you need to be—today, at
least—somewhat careful of what you say and how you say it. But it’s
more important that what you say reflects who you actually are, assuming
you’re someone the rest of us should respect.
Your personal brand matters a great deal in an era of rapid
economic changes, because you may move from job to job, perhaps even
creating your own, and even within a single company your career will
evolve. A personal brand does not mean notoriety, though some people
have made careers of being publicly outrageous. It does mean
establishing a reputation, because part of being valuable is being known
as more than a reliable cog in a system.
Your Home Page: A Portal to You
Whichever way you’ve decided to create your home base, the most
critical thing is to make it worthwhile. Easy to say, right? Actually, it’s not
so hard to do.
What should go into your own home base? Many things, but a few
are key. I advise including an About page, a blog and links to everything
else you’re doing on the Web (or as many as you can link to). How the
page looks matters, but the content is the most critical element. And, of
course, you want to be found.
98 Mediactive
My home page has a “static” blog post at the top—a post that holds
its position no matter what new blog postings I may write. There, I
briefly introduce myself and what I do, and I point to other relevant
pages on the site, including a more detailed About page as well as my
speaking calendar, contact information and, of course, the Mediactive
site. I specifically ask readers to think of the site as “a portal to (almost)
everything I’m doing, online and offline.”
My blogging at dangillmor.com consists mostly of personal
material, with some political, tech-related and other items as well that
don’t fit neatly into my professional blogging.
Surrounding my personal blog are links to, or full posts from,
many of the places where I post things elsewhere on the Net. They
include Twitter tweets, product and business reviews I’ve posted at
Amazon and Yelp, my Dopplr travel calendar, Flickr photos and
more. And, of course, there’s a link to the Amazon sales page for my
last book. How can all this appear so neatly on my page? Because of
RSS, which I described in Chapter 3; those sites let me create RSS
feeds of the material I create on them, which I can then easily import
into my site.
How often should you update your home base? That’s entirely
up to you. If you’re doing great stuff on Twitter or other sites that
pour information into your home base, you may not need to do
constant updates on your blog, but if this is the single place where you
blog the most, I recommend updating it at least twice a week. Those
updates may take the form of text postings, embedded videos,
podcasts or just about anything else. Some of the best blogs,
moreover, have lots of short posts with many links; remember that
linking is one of the basic values of the Web. Whatever you create,
you want it first of all to be worth your effort; even if you have only a
few readers or viewers, you are the person whose critiques matter
most in the end.
None of what I’ve described is complicated, though I keep wishing
for a service that would make it even easier to aggregate this “daily me”
onto my page more easily. New services are springing up to help you do
it on their sites—we’ll list them on the Mediactive site—and you can get
most of this done if you use iGoogle, MyYahoo, NetVibes and several
other big-name services.
However you do this, you should remember that you’re never
finished. For better or worse, your home base will always be a work in
progress, because you are a work in progress.
Dan Gillmor 99
About You
Your About page is where you get to define who you are and what
is at the core of your work and thoughts. If you are doing creative media,
especially journalism, your About page should also be the place where
you disclose anything that might be (or be perceived as) a conflict of
interest, though of course you should also disclose that in any postings
you make about relevant topics, as noted earlier.
If you have a resume or CV, link to it from the About page, both as
a downloadable PDF file and a Web-readable HTML file. If you give
talks, consider posting your speaking calendar (for privacy and security
reasons, some people don’t do this).
You should always include a way for others to contact you. You can
create a Web form for them to fill out, or you can provide an embedded
email address and phone number, or you can do all of these things. You
should also have a Contact link on your home page, and ideally on all
pages via a menu at the top.
I don’t change my About page very often, and you probably won’t,
either. Minor tweaks, yes, but this isn’t the place for discussing every
quarter-turn of the screw in your career or other goings-on. Define
yourself here in the broadest terms. Blog the smaller stuff.
Your Blog
I’m not a blogging determinist. That is, I don’t see blogs as
hammers and all problems as nails. But blogs are the best way, so far, to
provide updates on what you’re doing and why.
You may well have another, professional blog devoted to your
vocation or work life. You may want to blog only in one place, mixing
the professional and personal. These are individual decisions and depend
on how you work and whether you want to mix the personal with
everything else in a deep way.
It’s even possible that you might want to create a purely personal
blog somewhere other than your home-base site, if you’re worried that
people might misunderstand who you are based on its contents. If you
feel the need for that kind of content segregation, consider whether to
make that other blog pseudonymous (something I don’t recommend but
that is sometimes necessary).
What you blog on your home site is less relevant than the way you
do it. If you post items full of misspellings and grammatical errors, 
100 Mediactive
people will notice. Taking care matters. If your posts are tedious and selfcentered,
people will notice that, too. Self-awareness also matters.
As noted earlier, your update frequency is up to you. The only rule
that matters: Do what feels right to you.
When I comment at someone else’s site, especially if I’m
challenging what they’ve said about me or my work, I try to post an item
about it on my own blog. This works both ways. I’ve been embroiled in a
few major disputes over the years, and when that happens I make sure to
talk about the issues on my own site, and to point back to my own
thoughts from the comments elsewhere.
I strongly encourage opening your blog to comments. It’s possible
that no one will ever comment, but if you don’t give people the
opportunity to respond you are telling them you’re not really interested in
what they have to say. That defeats the conversational nature of media
and can reflect poorly on you.
Most blogging software and services give you options for handling
comments. I’ve set mine up so that I have to personally approve the first
posting by anyone commenting for the first time; after that, they’re free
to post. I also use anti-spam add-ons to my blogs, because the spammers
love to pollute blog comments the way they try to ruin everything else
they touch.
Look and Feel
I’m a fan of simplicity. If I can’t understand the purpose of a
website at first glance, I’m not inclined to stick around, much less come
back.
This is where blogs have a big advantage over other kinds of
software. They’re instantly recognizable for what they are, and modern
blogging services offer a variety of ways to easily create sidebars and
other ancillary material. The downside is that users tend to pick popular
blog themes, which can make them feel less unique.
A new wrinkle in the look-and-feel category is the rise of mobile
technology: More and more people are looking at the world through
small devices with small screens. Be sure to check out the way your site
looks on a mobile phone. If it’s a gigantic mess, find a way to make it
usable even on a small device. (See our online discussion of this at
Mediactive.com.)
Whatever you decide about how your site looks, remember that in
the end your taste is your own. Do it your way.
Dan Gillmor 101
Being Found
If no one can find what you’ve said about yourself, you might as
well not have said it. Which means that if search engines can’t find you,
you might as well not exist.
You should try to make your home-base site the first item on the
first page of search results for your name, particularly in Google. This is
not a matter of faking out the search companies—they look extremely
askance at such attempts—but rather of providing them with the kind of
information they need to recognize your page as the definitive item about
you.
This may be difficult if you have an extremely common name or
share the same (or even a similar) name with a celebrity. But if you’re the
John Smith who blogs about mobile phones and lives in Seattle, you
should be able to be found by anyone who has the slightest idea of who
they’re looking for.
Commenting on other people’s sites typically won’t help get you
into search rankings, though that shouldn’t stop you from doing it. The
blog comment spammers have so polluted the system that most blogging
software now tells search engines not to look at the links in comments.
Because search is so important, the field of “search engine
optimization” (SEO) has evolved into a huge and somewhat
controversial business. At mediactive.com we’ll be creating a list of some
reputable SEO sites and companies, as well as offering some specific tips
on how to optimize your home base so people can find you.
“YourSpace”—Owning Your Words
In the late 1980s I signed up for an account at an online bulletinboard
system called The WELL, short for Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link.
The WELL was way ahead of its time in almost every way, but one in
particular stands out even now. Users were greeted with this language:
You own your own words.
The context was primarily about responsibility, which we’ve
discussed in earlier chapters and will return to in Chapter 9. But there
was another context as well: literal ownership, that “no claims on your
copyrights were being made by The WELL, and that you would be
responsible for enforcing those rights.”
There was a catch, though. Suppose the WELL went out of
business. What would happened to my words? They’d disappear.
102 Mediactive
Fast forward to 2009, when Facebook launched a feature that became
immediately popular: It gave users a way to have URLs—Web addresses—
that included their actual real names or recognizable words chosen by the
users. I signed up, and my Facebook home page became
http://www.facebook.com/dangillmor instead of the previous URL, which
looked something like “http://www.facebook.com/234030i8234x2f.”
I did the same over at Google for my home page there. And I made
sure that on the other social networks and services I used the most, I
grabbed the dangillmor name, if possible; it’s my username on Twitter
and Skype, for example.
There are a huge number of services available today, and I have
every incentive to try for the dangillmor name at as many as possible.
One reason is to avoid confusion or semi-forgery. I’m not especially
worried that someone will take over my identity in this way, but there’s
no reason to invite trouble. Moreover, new services have emerged that
will help you—for a sometimes-substantial fee—nail down the username
of your choice, assuming it isn’t already taken, at dozens or even
hundreds of sites.
But nailing down my own name raised a bigger question: Did I—do
I—actually own my own name at on those services? The answer is an
emphatic “No,” because in reality I don’t own the information I put into
other people’s sites and services—and that information specifically
includes the vanity URL I’m permitted to claim.
This should be clear enough. But when Facebook expunged one of
its users in 2008, the event set off a mini-firestorm among people who
care about such things, prompting Daniel Solove to post this
admonishment at the Concurring Opinions blog:
(Y)ou exist on Facebook at the whim of Facebook. The
Facebook dieties [sic] can zap your existence for reasons even
more frivolous than those of the Greek gods. Facebook can
banish you because you’re wearing a blue T-shirt in your
photo, or because it selected you at random, or because you
named your blog Above the Law rather than Below the Law.
On the one hand, this rule seems uncontroversial. After all, it
is Facebook’s website. They own their site, and they have the
right to say who gets to use it and who doesn’t.
But on the other hand, people put a lot of labor and work into
their profiles on the site. It takes time and effort to build a
network of friends, to upload data, to write and create one’s 
Dan Gillmor 103
profile. Locking people out of this seizes all their work from
them. It’s like your employer locking you out of your office
and not letting you take your things. Perhaps at the very least
banished people should be able to reclaim the content of their
profiles. But what about all their “friends” on the network?
People spend a lot of time building connections, and they
can’t readily transplant their entire network of friends
elsewhere.
Since this incident, Facebook has opened up the user information
in several ways, including letting users access their basic feeds from other
websites and desktop applications, but only in specific ways that adhere
to Facebook’s strict rules. Facebook still controls the information,
though it graciously (ahem) allows you to download what you’ve created
there. So the reality is still this: It is Facebook’s site, and they have every
right to enforce their own rules, whether wise or ridiculous. Due process?
It’s not a judicial system, and we shouldn’t treat or even imagine it that
way.
The real issue is why users put so much of their own lives up on the
site. Most, I suspect, have no idea that what they post is only partly their
own, if at all. As with so many other services people use on today’s Web,
they may find out the hard way down the road. It’s the risk we take when
we make ourselves subject to the whims of little gods.
Mastering Your Domain
To the extent that such things are ownable, I own the Internet
domain dangillmor.com. (I also own gillmor.com and a bunch of other
domains including Mediactive.com, the website that hosts this project.)
What’s a domain? It’s your address on the Internet. Actually, it’s a
translation from a series of numbers—dangillmor.com is actually
207.58.180.217—that computers recognize via a series of cooperative
agreements that have been established over the years. Without the
Domain Name System, or DNS, the Net wouldn’t work.
You don’t need to care much about that. All you need to do is find
a registrar: a company that registers your preferred domain name for an
annual fee. Registrars abound, including big companies like Yahoo! that
offer registration as one of many products, big registrars like Network
Solutions and smaller firms like Tucows’ Hover.com service. As with all
kinds of businesses, cheap is not always synonymous with good. Several
registrars have gone out of business in recent years, causing major 
104 Mediactive
headaches for their customers. Wikipedia offers a list of widely used
registrars.
What’s the best domain name? Your own name, for most people. If
you can get the domain that goes FirstnameLastname.com, you should. If
you have an uncommonly spelled name, there’s a very good chance you
can get it. If it’s a common name, that’s harder, but you can try for a .net
or .org domain, or one of many others in the marketplace.
But you may want an entirely different kind of domain name, one
that reflects a particular interest. How can you find a good one? Contrary
to popular belief, all the good domains are not already taken. True, I got
gillmor.com back in the early days of the Web (and stupidly didn’t nail
down others that turned out to be valuable, because I lacked the
imagination to realize what a marketplace domain names would become).
But in 2008, when I was looking for a good domain name for the Knight
Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at Arizona State University,
the name startupmedia.org was available.
I’m agnostic about whether you need to be a dot-com—that is,
have an address that ends with “.com”—or whether it’s just as good to
use .org (typically for non-profits), .net or another so-called “top-level”
domain. There are all kinds of these available now, including .me, aimed
at personal sites. For now I’d suggest sticking with the major ones. (I’d
avoid .info, which seems to be a spammer favorite.)
If you have an idea for a domain, the easiest way to see if it’s already
taken is to visit the registrar and attempt to obtain it. You’ll know
immediately if someone else has it. Some registrars offer suggestions,
including related names. But my favorite way to come up with a domain
name is to use one of the clever Web services that let you play with
words and names, mixing and matching until you’ve discovered
something that works. One of my favorites is NameStation.com, which
lets you play with a variety of combinations until you find something you
like, and also checks its availability.
Hosting
Once you have a domain, you have to decide where to host it. This
means finding a service that provides servers and bandwidth. Many
registrars do both, and this is certainly the simplest way to go. There are
hundreds of hosting companies to choose from; the key is to find one
that meets your needs and offers the best combination of price, reliability
and service. As with registrars, your options range from companies like 
Dan Gillmor 105
Yahoo! to boutique services like the one I use, where, again, I know and
trust the owner.
A good hosting company will give you easy ways to create your site
on its servers. My hosting company, for example, will set up a WordPress
blog for me, and gives me online tools that let me create sites using
Drupal and many other, more flexible content-management systems
(CMSs). You’ll also get email services when you sign up with one of these
companies. This has its own value. Rather than using the email from the
Internet Service Provider where I live, I get my mail at dangillmor.com—
a domain that stays with me even if I move and change ISPs. Of course,
services like Gmail and Yahoo! mail also offer this portability, but I’d
rather keep my mail archives (the messages I choose to save, far from all
of them) on my computers than on someone else’s.
Hosting may sound like a pain. And to some degree it can be. You
may not need to get complicated in any way, though, if you just want to
create a simple home base using platform-specific software.
For example, you could start a blog at WordPress.com, which offers
hosted blogging services and gives you excellent flexibility in terms of the
look and feel, though you can customize even more if you have your own
WordPress (or other CMS) installation. Then, when you’ve created your
blog, you can point it—for a fee—to your personal domain. Outsiders
who go to your domain address will see the blog, which is hosted by
WordPress, but they’ll see it as part of your own domain. If you do this,
be sure to get a backup drive that backs up all of your data on a regular
basis.
Information Safety
I just emailed this chapter to myself.
Call me paranoid or merely careful, but I’ve become an advocate of
relentless, systematic backups of data. And when I post on other peoples
sites, I look for ways to take out what I’ve put in.
Backing Up
If you don’t back up your data, you are a fool. Sorry to be so blunt,
but I don’t offer this as nice-to-do advice.
My practice is fairly simple. I “clone” the hard drive of my
computer—i.e., make an exact copy—once a week. Every day, I back up
my current work files. I email my chapter drafts to myself. And I’m
looking into the online backup services—saving work into what people 
106 Mediactive
call “the cloud”—that are gaining popularity among the technocogniscenti.
Even with this regime, I still end up losing things, most typically
when a word-processing program—yes, Microsoft, I’m talking about
you—crashes in the middle of a chapter and somehow the changes I
thought I’d saved go missing. This doesn’t happen very often, but it’s
annoying and part of the process.
One way to have this happen less is to compose more of your drafts
online, via services like Google Documents. The risk of putting everything
into the cloud is that sometimes even companies you expect to be reliable
lose things. (A Microsoft-owned mobile data service, appropriately called
Danger, had just such an issue in mid-2009.) We did some of the editing of
this book in Google Documents with no mishap, but I was careful to
download the Mediactive Book folder frequently, just in case.
Your blog and other home-base material is almost certainly living in
the cloud. You should check with your hosting provider to ensure that
it’s performing regular backups. WordPress, Drupal and other packages
offer options to make backups of the data, on the server or
downloadable to your own computer.
My former employer deleted my entire archive of blog postings—
not just once, but twice.
The first time, around 2001, was because of a platform change
combined with the company’s misguided understanding of what the Web
was about; removing history struck me as perverse and still does. The
second time was after I left Knight Ridder in 2005; the reason given was
that it would be too costly to keep running the server—something that
again struck me as bizarre. But they had the right to delete it, even if I
though they were doing a dramatically wrong thing.
In 2009, we got a lot of it back, and we have restored most of the
old Knight Ridder blog to a site at Bayosphere.com (that’s another story,
which I won’t tell here, but you can read it at the site).
What prompted the project was the Web-sleuthing of blog historian
Rudolf Ammann, who used the wonderful Internet Archive to locate
many of the earliest posts. This made me wonder if it might be possible
to resurrect a lot more or even most of what had gone missing.
Pete Kaminski, a friend and technical whiz, took on the task. He’s
done an incredible job of spidering, scraping, parsing and otherwise
pulling as much as possibleout of the Archive.
We’re not nearly done. We’re looking for more of the EJournal, of
course—dozens or perhaps hundreds of posts are still missing, and may
be gone for good.
Dan Gillmor 107
I learned a big lesson from this experience. I no longer rely entirely
on the good graces of other people, including employers, to preserve
what I’ve created, much less keep it available for you to see. I try to rely
on myself.
Portable Data
When you start a blog at WordPress.com, you’ll discover something
wonderful, should you dig deep enough into the system settings: You can
take it with you if you decide to leave. WordPress offers a backup system
that includes a way to email the entire database of content to yourself at
regular intervals, and the open-source WordPress community has written
many plug-ins to make this and similar processes easy and robust.
Even when you can readily get your data out of a site or service,
that doesn’t mean you’re home free. Downloading the WordPress
database is only the first step if you want to move it into another
blogging software system. It can be done, but it’s not always easy.
The WordPress community is serious about this issue, though, and
it’s offering support to a movement that is gaining strength in this era of
multiple sites and services where we post words, pictures, videos and
more. The movement wants to make our data portable, so that we aren’t
locked into someone else’s system or method of doing things.
In general, when you’re using other people’s services you should
always look for evidence that you can get out what you’ve put in. You
should also keep copies of pictures and videos you upload.
Owning Your Honor
We have no idea yet what it means for mostly private citizens to live
semi-public lives in the Digital Age. We’ll be figuring this out for years,
even decades, to come.
But we do know that we have to define ourselves, or risk having
others define us. They’ll do so in any event, but if we don’t make our
own case for who we are, we’re missing an opportunity.
