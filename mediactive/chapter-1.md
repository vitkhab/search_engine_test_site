# Chapter 1
Darwin’s Media
The email arrived in early January 2010 via a colleague, who got it from
his father, who got it from a mail list. It began, “Do you remember
1987….”
The formatting and style were amateurish, and the tone just-folks. It
went, in part:
Thought you might be interested in this forgotten bit of information.........
It was 1987! At a lecture the other day they were playing an old news
video of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings
during the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and
country getting the third degree, but what he said was stunning!
He was being drilled by a senator, ‘Did you not recently spend close to
$60,000 for a home security system?’
Ollie replied, ‘Yes, I did, Sir.’
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, ‘Isn’t that
just a little excessive?’
‘No, sir,’ continued Ollie.
‘No? And why not?’ the senator asked.
‘Because the lives of my family and I were threatened, sir.’
‘Threatened? By whom?’ the senator questioned.
‘By a terrorist, sir’ Ollie answered.
‘Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?’
‘His name is Osama bin Laden, sir,’ Ollie replied.
At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn’t pronounce
it, which most people back then probably couldn’t. A couple of people
laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.
Why are you so afraid of this man?’ the senator asked.
‘Because, sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of,’ Ollie
answered.

‘And what do you recommend we do about him?’ asked the senator.
‘Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team
be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.’
The senator disagreed with this approach, and that was all that was
shown of the clip.
By the way, that senator was Al Gore!
Pretty alarming stuff, yes? Actually, no—because it’s fiction, in
service of outright propaganda. Oliver North never said any of this in any
Senate hearing. Neither did Al Gore. (I know because, among other
things, I checked with the Snopes website, where reality rules. I’ll tell you
more about Snopes in Chapter 3.)
What was going on here? It’s simple, actually, as many of these
kinds of emails tend to be. There were at least three plain goals: 1) Turn
Oliver North, a right-wing icon of the 1980s, into a modern hero; 2) turn
Al Gore, a born-again liberal, into a dunce; 3) use the fictional situation
to promote the idea of preemptive military action and state-sponsored
assassination. There’s an honest case to be made for 3), but this email’s
fundamental dishonesty undermined that case for anyone who’d done the
slightest homework.
My colleague had made it clear in his forward that he was skeptical.
But how many people along the chain, before it reached his inbox and
mine, had taken it for granted?
I don’t have to tell you about the information mess, of which that
email is just one tiny but toxic piece of flotsam. In an era of media
overflow, we’re swimming in the real and the unreal, and sometimes we
wonder if we’ll sink.
We won’t—or at least, we don’t have to. Sure, we find ourselves in
a radically democratized and decentralized media culture that’s producing
an overload of information, an alarming amount of which is deceitful or
just mistaken. But as we’ll explore in upcoming chapters, this culture is
also responding with important new tools and techniques for managing
the flow and determining what’s real and what’s not.
Moreover, even as some people are spreading garbage, whether
deliberately or inadvertently, others are giving us genuine hope for a
future that’s rich in trustworthy and timely information.
Consider, for example, the Ushahidi project and co-founder, Ory
Okolloh, a Kenyan lawyer living in South Africa. In the wake of the
horrific 2010 Haiti earthquake, Ushahidi—originally created to track
election news in Kenya—launched an interactive “Crisis Map of Haiti” to
track events in the shattered island nation. Information came in from 
Dan Gillmor 3
people on the ground via SMS, the Web, email, radio, phone, Twitter,
Facebook, live Internet streams and other reports. Volunteers at the
Fletcher School of Diplomacy’s “situation room” read the reports before
mapping them, discarding items they considered unreliable.
Who was this for? Anyone who needed or wanted it, but the Ushahidi
team hoped, in particular, that the humanitarian community would use the
map as a guide. That’s exactly what did happen. As a Marine Corps
representative in Haiti texted to the organization, “I can not over-emphasize
to you what Ushahidi has provided. Your site is saving lives every day.”
Everywhere I turn these days I find people like Okolloh working to
build and refine an information ecosystem we can use to make better
decisions. Some are media creators. Others are helping us sort it all out.
And many, like Okolloh, do a combination of both.
To make the most of what they’re doing, each of us will need to
recognize our opportunity—and then act on it. When we have unlimited
sources of information, and when so much of what comes at us is
questionable, our lives get more challenging. They also get more interesting.
Information overflow requires us to take an active approach to
media, in part to manage the flood pouring over us each day, but also to
make informed judgments about the significance of what we see. Being
passive receivers of news and information, our custom through the late
20th century era of mass media, isn’t adequate in the new century’s Digital
Age mediasphere, where information comes at us from almost
everywhere, and from almost anyone.
That anyone can include you and me, and our neighbors and their
neighbors. Somebody created that propaganda email about things Ollie
North and Al Gore never said in the Iran-Contra hearings. Yet you, or I,
or almost anyone we know, can create something as trustworthy as that
piece of fiction was deceitful. That this door has opened to us is a
powerfully positive and democratizing development. But anyone who
steps through it needs to engage in a new kind of media literacy, based on
key principles for both consumers and creators, which we’ll delve into
starting in the next chapter.
The time to work on this is right now. Our democratized 21st
century media are a land of opportunity, and of peril. How we live, work
and govern ourselves in a digital age depends in significant ways on how
well we use those media.
The next two chapters will offer practical and effective ways to
understand the digital media landscape and to apply that understanding in
our daily lives. First, though, let’s look back in time just a bit—some
history will help us put today’s world into context.

How Did We Get Here?
It has taken millennia for humanity to produce democratized media.
When early humans started drawing on the walls of caves, they created a
lasting record of things that mattered. Stationary cave walls gave way to
rock and clay tablets, which in turn were supplanted by papyrus and
animal-skin documents, including scrolls. Early books—single editions
created by scribes—came next, setting the stage for what I think of as
Media 1.0: the printing press.
Moveable type and the printing press, taking its early and most famous
form as Gutenberg’s Bible, liberated the word of God from the control of
the priests. This was humanity’s first profound democratization of media.
Printing presses spread the words of individuals to many readers, in books,
pamphlets, newspapers, magazines and more. Regimes shook, and some fell.
Civilizations changed irrevocably.
When the telegraph first moved information over long distances at
the speed of light, we’d hit a new turning point. Call it Media 1.5—the
information moved from point to point but not directly to the people.
This led to the next epochal shift.
Broadcasting is Media 2.0: mass media traveling long distances
instantaneously. The radio brought news and information, plus the sound
of the human voice, with an immediacy that led to the rise of both the
great and the wicked. Franklin Roosevelt did much to calm a troubled
nation with his fireside chats, while Hitler used radio, among other
media, to pull his nation into outright savagery.
Television engaged eyes in addition to ears, adding the moving
images of film to radio broadcasting’s immediacy. It was a huge shift
(Media 2.5), but not as great as what was to come.
The Internet is Media 3.0, combining all that has come before and
extending it across the web of connections that includes everything from
email to the World Wide Web. It is radically democratized media, in ways
that we are only now beginning to understand well. But with this opening
of what had been a mostly closed system, possibilities emerge, literally
without limit.
And it’s good thing, given what’s happening to traditional media.
The Rise and Decline of Media Institutions
The same technology advances that have given us Media 3.0 have
been near-catastrophic, at least in a financial sense, for what we now
think of as the journalism industry—the collection of powerful corporate 
Dan Gillmor 5
producers of journalism that emerged in the second half of the 20th
century. Especially in the past decade, reality has collided—hard—with
the news business. Publications and broadcasts are hollowed-out shells of
their former selves.
What happened? The easy answer is that advertising disappeared.
True, but too easy. Let’s look a little more deeply.
The seeds were planted decades ago, when it became clear that
newspapers and local television stations were becoming licenses to print
money. The reason: The barrier to entry—the cost of presses and broadcast
licenses, among other things potential competitors would need to enter
those marketplaces—was too high. In the daily newspaper business
competition was narrowing dramatically; by the latter part of the last century
communities of any size with more than one newspaper were rare. So
newspapers were monopolies, and local TV stations were oligopolies.
Monopoly meant charging ever-higher prices, not so much to
subscribers, but to the advertisers who had nowhere else to turn in their
communities if they had something they wanted to sell to the widest
possible customer base. Nowhere were profit margins higher than in
classified ads, those one- or two-line notices that filled page after page in
most papers. In fact, for most newspapers classifieds provided the
number one source of profits.
Wall Street loved the newspaper corporations, because monopolies
are great fun for owners while they last; you can keep raising prices and
no one can stop you. So when newspaper companies sold shares to the
public, often to raise capital so they could buy up more papers, investors
bid up the prices of the companies. The companies bought more and
more papers: Profit margins kept soaring, and so did stock prices.
As Wall Street and private owners alike demanded higher returns, in
many (if not most) markets monopoly newspaper managers became
complacent and arrogant, to varying degrees—it’s what monopolists tend
to do. Rarely did managers care all that much about their communities;
they were really just visiting on their way up the corporate ladders. The
chief way they could please their bosses was to pull more profits from
the local communities, by not just charging more for ad space, but also
trimming back the budgets for journalism.
One thing they trimmed was journalism that aimed to serve people
on the lower demographic rungs. Over time, most large daily papers
increasingly aimed their coverage almost solely at the top 40 percent or so
of the communities they served, in terms of household income—because
those were the people the advertisers wanted to target. So newspapers
were losing touch with their communities as they chased profits.
6 Mediactive
The Internet brought competition for the advertising dollars, as
sites like eBay, Monster (jobs), craigslist and others gave advertisers a
much lower price for a much better service. It didn’t take long for the
classified advertising business to melt, and with it the main source of
profits at most papers. It will never come back.
Display advertising, meanwhile, was going through its own
evolution. Newspapers depended mostly on big local merchants, notably
department stores, for display ads. But economic forces led to
consolidation of the retail marketplace—among other industries that
tended to use newspaper ads heavily to reach consumers—and bang,
another revenue source was gone for good.
Television’s unwinding happened in different ways and at a
different pace. TV is still a hugely popular medium and will remain so
for decades to come, but the rise of cable and satellite gave viewers
and advertisers more choices. These shifts were part of an upheaval
for local TV, which at one time boasted profit margins that would
make the greediest newspaper executive jealous. The effect of
competition—and, I’m convinced, a relentless dumbing down of
television journalism to the point that it was pure info-tainment—
pushed audiences away.
And as all these financial storms were brewing, mass media
audiences were joining advertisers in exploring the Internet’s vast and
diverse possibilities.
Democratized Information to the Rescue
The Internet didn’t just take advertising away from print publishers
and advertisers—it also brought democratized information to all of us.
Actual competition for journalism, not just revenue, began appearing.
And here, too, the industry has been ill-prepared.
As newspapers were coming apart at the seams, many traditional
journalists began fretting that journalism itself was at risk. Who would do
the journalism if the established business model died? How would the
public be informed?
The anguish and hand-wringing, of course, raised a couple of
questions.
First, by what standard had traditional journalists done such a
sterling job that they were irreplaceable? To be sure, there had been some
superb reporting over the years; the best journalism was as good as it had
ever been. But some of our top reporters had helped lead America into a
war started under false pretenses. And they’d almost entirely missed the 
Dan Gillmor 7
building financial bubble that nearly ruined the nation. Newspapers
increasingly focused on celebrity and gossip. They pretended to find two
sides to every story, even when one side was an outright lie. Was this a
craft that deserved our unreserved faith?
Second, did the unquestionably hard economic times for the
journalists’ employers mean that journalism itself would no longer exist if
the employers disappeared? From my perspective, it seemed as though
people working for traditional media companies were arguing that their
enterprises had some near-divine right to exist. Not in the universe you
and I inhabit!
I’m an optimist. I and others like me see renewal amid the
destruction. We don’t worry so much about the supply of news and
opinion, though we do recognize that a shifting marketplace for
information—from monopoly and oligopoly to a new, competitive
mediasphere—will be messy.
Count on this: Tomorrow’s media will be more diverse, by far, than
today’s. We can imagine, therefore, a journalism ecosystem that’s a vital
part of our expanded mediasphere and vastly healthier and more useful
than the monocultural media of recent times—if we get it right. That we
means all of us. Remember, Digital Age media are broadly distributed
and participatory—broadly democratic.
For sure, we’re headed for a time of abundance, at least in quantity. In
that abundance we’ll have plenty of quality, too, but it’ll be more difficult to
sort out. To assure a continued supply of quality information, we have to
address the other side of a classic economic and social equation: demand for
information that’s reliable and trustworthy. That’s up to you and me.
Trust and Reliability
In this emergent global conversation, as we ride a tsunami of
information, what can we trust?
Trust and credibility issues are not new to the Digital Age.
Journalists of the past have faced these questions again and again, and the
Industrial Age rise of what people called “objective journalism”—
allegedly unbiased reporting—clearly did not solve the problem.
We don’t have to look back very far to note some egregious cases.
The New York Times’s Jayson Blair saga, in which a young reporter spun
interviews and other details from whole cloth, showed that even the best
news organizations are vulnerable. The Washington press corps, with
dismayingly few exceptions, served as a stenography pool for the
government in the run-up to the Iraq War. And so on.
8 Mediactive
The credibility problem of traditional media goes much deeper.
Almost everyone who has ever been the subject of a news story can point
to small and sometimes large errors of fact or nuance, or to quotes that,
while perhaps accurate, are presented out of their original context in ways
that change their intended meaning. It’s rarely deliberate; shallowness is a
more common media failing than malice.
Having said that, I greatly appreciate what traditional news people
give us in many cases: their best efforts in a deadline-driven craft. Despite
the minor errors, the better media organizations get things pretty much
right (except, of course, when they go horribly awry, as in missing the
financial bubble until it was too late). The small mistakes undermine any
notion of absolute trust, but I tend to have some faith that there’s still
something worthwhile about the overall effort.
Most traditional media organizations try to avoid the worst
excesses of bad journalism through processes aimed both at
preventing mistakes and, when they inevitably occur, setting the
record straight. Yet too many practitioners are bizarrely reluctant to
do so. As I write this, it has been more than a year since the
Washington Post published an editorial based on an absolutely false
premise, which I documented in my blog and passed along to the
paper’s ombudsman, who passed it along to the editorial page editor.
The editorial page has neither corrected nor acknowledged the error,
an outrageous failure of its journalistic responsibility.
I still don’t know why the Post refuses to deal with this mistake, now
compounded through inaction, but I do know that the silence betrays
another major failing in the mass media: a lack of transparency from
people who demand it of others. I’ll discuss this at much greater length
later. (On the subject of transparency, I should note that I have
relationships, financial and otherwise, with some of the institutions and
people I discuss or quote in this book. My online disclosure page,
dangillmor.com/about, lists many such relationships, and I’ll mention
them in this book either directly or with appropriate links.)
One of the most serious failings of traditional journalism has been
its reluctance to focus critical attention on a powerful player in our
society: journalism itself. The Fourth Estate rarely gives itself the same
scrutiny it sometimes applies to the other major institutions. (I say
“sometimes” because, as we’ve seen in recent years, journalists’ most
ardent scrutiny has been aimed at celebrities, not the governments,
businesses and other entities that have the most influence, often
malignant, on our lives.)
Dan Gillmor 9
A few small publications, notably the Columbia Journalism Review,
have provided valuable coverage of the news business over the years. But
these publications circulate mostly within the field and can look at only a
sliver of the pie. As we’ll see in upcoming chapters, the “Fifth Estate” of
online media critics is helping to fill the gap.
The new media environment, however rich with potential for
excellence, has more than a few reliability issues of its own. It’s at least
equally open to error, honest or otherwise, and persuasion morphs into
manipulation more readily than ever. There’s a difference between lack of
transparency and deception, though. Some of the more worrisome
examples of this fall in the political arena, but less-than-honorable media
tactics span a wide spectrum of society’s activities.
Consider just a few examples:
 Procter & Gamble and Walmart, among other major
companies, have been caught compensating bloggers and social
networkers for promoting the firms or their products without
disclosing their corporate ties. This stealth marketing, a
malignant form of what’s known as “buzz marketing,” caused
mini-uproars in the blogging community, but a frequently asked
question was whether these campaigns were, as most believe,
just the tip of the iceberg of paid influence.
 Meanwhile, new media companies have created the blogging
and social networking equivalents of the “advertorials” we find
in newspapers, compensating people for blogging, Tweeting
and the like and not always providing or requiring adequate
disclosure. Federal regulators have been sufficiently alarmed by
these and other practices that they’ve enacted regulations aimed
at halting abuses; unfortunately, as we’ll see later, the new rules
could go to far if enforced too strictly.
 President Barack Obama has been the target of mostly
shadowy, though sometime overt, rumors and outright lies.
They range from the laughable to the truly slimy. What they
have in common is that during the election campaign they were
plainly designed to poison voters’ attitudes in swing states.
During Obama’s presidency, they have been designed to
discredit his authority among a large swath of the American
people. The people behind these campaigns have succeeded to a
degree that should scare every honest citizen. A nontrivial
percentage of Americans believe Obama is a Muslim and 
10 Mediactive
originally a citizen of Kenya. If the latter were true, which it is
not, Obama would be disqualified from holding his office.
 On blogs and many other sites where conversation among the
audience is part of the mix, we often encounter sock puppets—
people posting under pseudonyms instead of their real names, and
either promoting their own work or denigrating their opponents,
sometimes in the crudest ways. As with the buzz marketing, it’s
widely believed that the ones getting caught are a small percentage
of the ones misusing these online forums. Sock puppetry predates
the Internet and has never gone out of style in traditional media,
but it’s easier than ever to pull off online.
Craig Newmark, founder of the craigslist online advertising and
community site, famously says that most people online are good and that
a tiny percentage do the vast majority of the harm. This is undoubtedly
correct. Yet as Craig, a friend, would be the first to say, knowing that
doesn’t solve the problem; it takes individual and community effort, too.
In a world with seemingly infinite sources of information, trust is
harder to establish. But we can make a start by becoming better informed
about what we read, hear and watch.
Innovation and Participation
Because we’ve become accustomed to a media world dominated by
monopolies and oligopolies, we still tend to imagine that just a few big
institutions will rise from the sad rubble of the 20th century journalism
business. That’s not happening—at least. not anytime soon. As I said earlier,
we’re heading into an incredibly messy but also wonderful period of
innovation and experimentation that will combine technology and people
who push ideas both stunning and outlandish into the world. The result will
be a huge number of failures, but also a large number of successes.
One of the failures was mine. In 2005 I helped launch an
experimental local Web journalism project called Bayosphere, and made
just about every mistake in the entrepreneur’s goof-kit. But since then
I’ve also invested in several new media enterprises. I co-founded a site
with a media component—users telling each other about where they
were traveling, and giving advice on what to do once they got there—that
worked well enough to be bought by a big company.*
(I’m also involved

*My role in the second startup, Dopplr.com, was much less hands-on than my first one.
I’m not sure if there’s a correlation between the demise of the first and success of the
second.
Dan Gillmor 11
in several startups as an advisor, and serve as an advisor or board
member on several media-related non-profits.)
I can’t begin to list all of the great experiments I’m seeing right
now. I’ll explore many of them on the Mediactive website
(mediactive.com), and mention at least a few in this book.
What’s important is the breadth and depth of the innovations we’re
already seeing—even now, before the traditional media have disappeared
or evolved. The experiments and startups range from not-for-profits
doing investigative reporting to data-driven operations at the hyper-local
level to aggregators of journalism from many sources, and include any
number of other kinds of enterprises.
In one journalistic arena in particular, new media have pretty much
replaced the old: the world of technology. The widening array of
coverage, with some of the best focusing on narrow audiences and topic
niches, has not only superseded the magazines and (shallow) newspaper
coverage of old, but is deeper and fundamentally better. Some of this is
exemplary journalism. Not all topics will lend themselves to this kind of
transition, as we’ll discuss later, but there’s every reason to believe that
many of today’s weakly covered topics and issues will enjoy better
journalism in the future.
I’m still having fun working on new media projects, but my
money—literally, not just figuratively—is on a younger generation. For
the past several years, while continuing to write and publish journalism
online and in newspapers and magazines, including regular publication in
the online magazine Salon.com, I’ve been working in academia. Currently
I teach at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of
Journalism and Mass Communication, where I’m helping to bring
entrepreneurship and the startup culture into the curriculum. We’ve
encouraged students in a variety of programs, not just journalism, to
team up and create new kinds of community-focused information
products and services. Several have landed funding to take their ideas
further, and all have shown the kind of potential that tells me we’ll get
this right in the end. I envy my students, and I tell them so; they and
countless others like them around the world are inventing our media
future, and the field is wide open for them in ways that I could not have
imagined when I started my own career.
At the Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship, the ASU
project we launched in 2008, my colleagues and I make this point to our
students at the outset of every semester: There’s almost no barrier to
entry if you want to do something in digital media.
12 Mediactive
The tools for creating news and community information are
increasingly in everyone’s hands. The personal computer that I’m using
to write this book comes equipped with media creation and editing tools
of such depth that I can’t begin to learn all their capabilities. The device I
carry in my pocket boasts features such as Web browsing, email, video
recording and playback, still-camera mode, audio recording, text
messaging, GPS location sensing, compass headings and much more; oh,
and it’s a phone, too.
The other side of the media-democratization coin is access.
With traditional media, we produced something, usually
manufacturing it, and then distributed it: We put it in delivery trucks or
broadcast it to receivers.
With new media, we create things and make them available; people
come and get them. Now, this isn’t as simple as I’ve just made it sound.
We get things in a variety of ways, such as RSS “feeds” and daily emails
that come to us from many news sources; we also explore Webpages,
Twitter tweets, Facebook messages, videos and so much more. Web
publishers still look for ways to grow audiences. But I think of
“distribution” in the new media world as the process of making sure that
the people long known as consumers—that would be us—can find
what’s being created not only by commercial and institutional publishers,
but by all of us.
Publishers and online service providers especially crave audiences
whose members become active participants in a community. That’s how
some new media empires are made today: by helping the former audience
become part of the process.
As media democratization turns people from mere consumers into
potential creators, something else is happening. We are becoming
collaborators, because so many of the new tools of creation are
inherently collaborative. We have only begun to explore the meaning,
much less the potential, of this reality. All I can say is, wow.
It’s Up to Us, Not “Them”
In mid-to-late 2009, if you were paying even the slightest attention
to the legislative debate over America’s messed-up system of health care,
you heard again and again about “death panels.” These were the shadowy
governmental bodies that opponents claimed would decide your fate if
the Democratic-controlled Congress enacted just about any major shifts
away from the current system. Tens of millions of Americans believed
this, and many still do.
Dan Gillmor 13
But if you were paying sufficiently close attention, you’ll came to
realize that the reports of death panels were not merely inaccurate; they
were outrageous lies. They’d been concocted by opponents of pretty
much anything the President might propose. (It should go without
saying, but I’ll say it anyway: Democrats have been known to lie to make
political points, too—the Democrats’ tendency to equate taxpayersubsidized
with “free” is an ongoing abuse of language and logic—but
the death panel invention was especially egregious.)
The death panels lost their power in the public mind for several
reasons. Most importantly, the charge was so inflammatory that some
traditional media organizations did something unusual: They stopped
simply quoting “both sides” of an issue that had a true side and a false
side, and reported what was true. Of course, not all media
organizations did this, and some continued to promote the falsehoods.
But the issue was significant enough, and the consequences alarming
enough if the charges had been true, that many people spent the extra
time it took to figure out what they could trust. The public, by and
large, learned the truth. And the health-care debate shed at least one
flagrant deception.
We need to do this more often. We have no real choice.
When we have unlimited sources of information, and when the Big
Media organizations relentlessly shed their credibility and resources in the
face of economic and journalistic challenges, life gets more confusing.
The days when we had the easy but misguided luxury of relying on Big
Media are gone.
With new tools and old principles, we’ll break away from the
passive-consumption role to become active users of media: hands-on
consumers and creators. This won’t only be good for society, though it
certainly will be. We’ll be better off individually, too. The cliché
“Information is power” is true for you and me only if we have
trustworthy information.
Above all, hands-on mediactivity is satisfying, and often fun. By
being mediactive, you’ll get used to gauging the reliability of what you
see, pushing deeper into various topics and following the many threads
of arguments to reach your own conclusions—not on everything, of
course, but on the issues that you care about the most. And when you’ve
made that process part of your life, you’ll have trouble waiting for the
next break in your day so you can get back to to the satisfaction that it
brings.
