“I don’t know a whole lot about nonfiction journalism. . . The way that I think about these things, and in terms of what I can do is. . . essays like this are occasions to watch somebody reasonably bright but also reasonably average pay far closer attention and think at far more length about all sorts of different stuff than most of us have a chance to in our daily lives.”

- David Foster Wallace
